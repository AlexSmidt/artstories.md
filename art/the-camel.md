Step right up, don’t be shy! See the amazing wonders woven into this surreal tapestry! This is the call of the exotic, a fantastical depiction of an Eastern king awaiting entertainment while unusual marvels are presented to him: peacocks, leopards, rope-walking acrobats, musical delights, and (the tapestry’s namesake) a camel. It’s not the king who was truly fascinated by this scene, though; it was the French aristocrats who hung it in their home. While not an accurate depiction of Eastern culture, the tapestry is a true example of Western fascination with the lands beyond Europe.

## Threads of marble

The king and his entertainers are depicted as sitting on pedestals of marble—an impressive artistic feat, as the illusion was created by weaving together different-colored threads. The threads are layered to capture the gradual change of color within marble, as well as the delicate veins that run through it.

## Fit for a king

The king sits atop a raised platform next to a sphinx and holds an impressive staff—all stereotypical symbols of an Eastern ruler. But if he really were a ruler from the East, those peacocks, leopards, and camels would hardly seem exotic. These entertainments really are meant to delight the European viewers looking at the tapestry.

## On the ropes

Acrobats sit atop tightropes meant to entertain the king with their daring and exceptional balance. One wears wings, perhaps to take flight should he fall or because wings were a popular part of costumes for entertainers in the late 1600s.

## Behind the mask

The entertainer’s mask is fit for a ball! Specifically, a Venetian Masquerade Ball, celebrations in which guests wore elaborate masks throughout the night, a tradition begun during Carnival season in the 1400s. 

## Leaping lizards...or frogs

The performer’s long pants were considered typically Eastern, but the fastenings along the front of the tunic are European. Called frogs, or toggles, these ties were ornate fasteners for clothing consisting of a button, toggle, or knot that fits through a loop.

## Music to my eyes

What song can be played with a harp, violin, and tambourine? There’s no good musical explanation for the unusual assemblage of instruments wielded by the entertainers. Their European clothes, however, are yet another hint at the tapestry’s Western audience. 

## An exotic menagerie

Peacock, leopard, camel, and parrots all take center stage for the king’s pleasure. It’s an unusual group of animals but typical of exoticism, the fantastical European take on the East that made the unknown vague and generic with exotic embellishments.

## The grotesque

Animals, acrobats, and even the decorative floral embellishments seem to be frolicking in unidentifiable space—just where is this fanciful kingdom? The lack of ordered design classifies this tapestry as a grotesque, a combination of strange characters and imaginary hybrid creatures intended to delight the viewer.
