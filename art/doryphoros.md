The ideal body. We all want it, and our never-ending struggle to get it sells magazines and gym memberships and Spanx (when we finally give up). Ideals of beauty vary between cultures, but the idea of the ideal is in everyone’s nature. Thousands of years ago, the celebrated Greek sculptor Polykleitos argued that the human ideal could be distilled down to numbers, and offered The Doryphoros, or Spear Bearer, as the perfect man, reflecting mathematically precise proportions. This is one of the four surviving Roman copies of the Greek original, now lost.

## What Defines Beauty?

“Beauty is in the eye of the beholder,” we often say. Followers of Polykleitos would have argued otherwise. Perfection, he said, is the result of harmonious proportions: those who attain it are akin to gods (or Tom Brady and Giselle, the modern equivalent). We value the same ideals today, whether it be Giselle’s high cheekbones or Brady’s square jaw.

## The Proportions

At six-foot-six, The Doryphoros silently struts his stuff. With a 19.5-inch neck, a 46-inch chest, and a 40-inch waist, he is a force to be reckoned with. Polykleitos used a 1 to 7 head-to-body ratio for this statue. Another exemplar of male proportion, Barbie’s boyfriend, Ken, is much more slender: blown up to six-foot-six he would only have a 40-inch chest and 28-inch waist.

## The Doryphoros Effect

The Doryphoros composition heavily influenced Greek and Roman art, which in turn affected Western art and the use of proportions even in architecture. Leonardo da Vinci’s famous Vitruvian Man is based on the Roman architect Vitruvius’ writings—which reflect Polykleitos’s ideas.

## The Struggle to Achieve

Polykleitos’ treatise, *Canon*, spelled out the requirements for beauty: balance and proportion, not only of the body as a whole, but the relationship of one part to another—finger to finger, fingers to wrist, wrist to forearm, etc. 

## Perfection is Unattainable

Alas, Polykleitos’ proportions are nearly unattainable unless you’ve won the genetic lottery. That hasn’t stopped people from trying, however. Plastic surgery can alter size and symmetry, while tailored clothes and high heels aid with ideal height and proportions.
