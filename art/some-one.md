It appears as armor, a modern take on a traditional Asian war robe. But look closely: those are military dog tags—thousands of them—accumulated to form a single, collective force. Outside, the shell seems invulnerable; inside, the beckoning mirrored space reflects the lone individual looking in, a contrast often noted by veterans. Visiting as part of the MIA’s “Honoring the Warrior” tour, they’re especially drawn to this artwork and its familiar juxtaposition: the collective power of the military versus the individual vulnerabilities of any one soldier.
