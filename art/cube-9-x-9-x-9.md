Everything about this sculpture, from its imposing physical presence to its construction of barbed wire, seems threatening and dangerous. Why did Mona Hatoum choose this unconventional material? In this case the medium is the message: she presents viewers with art materials that trigger feelings of discomfort and uncertainty.  Because she was born in Lebanon to Palestinian parents, and forced into exile in London when civil war broke out in her home country, it would be easy to view her work as biographical. Hatoum rejects this, instead stating that her work means different things to different viewers because of the associations each of us bring to the encounter with the artwork and its materials.
