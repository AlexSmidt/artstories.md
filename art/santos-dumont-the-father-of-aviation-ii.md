To Brazilians and many others, he is the father of aviation. The Rio de Janerio airport is named for him, and on a monument there a winged figure soars above the crumpled bodies of those whose earlier attempts to fly didn’t go so well. Alberto Santos-Dumont was the contemporary and equal of the Wright brothers—except in America, where his buried legacy inspired Kehinde Wiley to depict the monument in a painting. He used people he met in Rio’s slums as models, men whose background might cause them to be forgotten just as Santos-Dumont has been left on the runway of history.

## Brazilian Innovators

Wiley posed his models to resemble the two crumpled figures at the base of the monument to Albert Santos-Dumont at the Rio de Janeiro airport. Above them soars a man with wings, symbolizing the long human quest for flight.

## History Revisited

Wiley’s works are based, in their style and scale, on monumental European paintings dating back to the 1600s. In presenting black people in this heroic context, he raises a pointed question: Why have so few black heroes received this treatment in art or the media?

## Modern Adornment

In European portraits, the rich and powerful often flaunted their wealth. Wiley updates the tradition, linking old opulence to today’s hip-hop style, by  highlighting the men’s jewelry.  

## Eyes Open

Wiley paints the fallen men with their eyes open, looking directly at the viewer. This gives them an aura of ownership, of purchase—they’re aware of how they’re being seen.
