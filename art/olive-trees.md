He had wandered all his life, from the Netherlands to Belgium to Paris, before settling in the south of France in February 1888. Van Gogh came in search of sun, new light to drive his interest in color, and to establish a community of artists. He invited the painter Paul Gauguin to join this “Studio of the South.” Just two months after Gauguin’s arrival, Van Gogh suffered a breakdown. He sliced off part of his own ear, and a terrified Gauguin promptly left, never to return. By May 1889, little more than a year after arriving in the south, Van Gogh had checked himself into Saint-Paul Asylum in Saint-Rémy, where he spent months studying and painting the asylum’s olive groves.

## The Sun Appears

Van Gogh filled 15 canvases with olive groves between June and December of 1889. This is the only one that features the sun.

## Room with a View

Initially confined to the asylum grounds, Van Gogh painted the hallways and a walled garden that he could see from his room. When he was finally free to wander, he painted the surrounding countryside, especially its olive groves, cypresses, and wheat fields.

## Debt to Delacroix

Eugene Delacroix’s art profoundly influenced Van Gogh. In fact, Van Gogh’s use of muted halftones (between the brightest and darkest value of that color) and his characteristically brushy, hatching technique were inspired by Delacroix’s *Women of Algiers in their Apartment*, which Van Gogh had recently seen.

## Olives in Autumn

Van Gogh painted the olive groves throughout his stay at the asylum. The colors he used varied depending on the season, the light of day, and his mood. In November, when he created this painting, Van Gogh wrote, “… at present I am working in the olive trees, seeking the different effects of a grey sky against yellow earth, with dark green note of the foliage, another time the earth and foliage all purplish against a yellow sky, then red ochre earth and pink and green sky.”
