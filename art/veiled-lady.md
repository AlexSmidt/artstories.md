<p>She is no one in particular. In fact, she exists only in your mind—a beautiful illusion, an elegant parlor trick, played by a sculptor to show off his skill. You can’t see through stone any more than you can saw a woman in half onstage. But tricks of light and polish, as well as the supple curves of the veil, suggest that you can. Veiled statues, widely produced in the 18th century and again in the 19th, were set on pedestals in the elegant homes of Europe as irresistible conversation pieces, anonymous beauties hiding behind a veil of virtuosity.</p>

## Tricks Revealed
<p>Her head and shoulders are polished smooth. But where the veil falls across the face, the marble is less polished, suggesting the texture of fabric. Also, the tightness of the veil in some places and looseness elsewhere creates an illusion of depth.</p>

## Seeing through stone
<p>You can’t actually see through stone—or can you? Like a magician picking his props, sculptor Raffaelo Monti chose the right material to fool the eye: marble, so marvelously translucent that it has long been used to simulate skin, fabric, or in this case both.  </p>

## Who is she?
<p>Veiled ladies were vehicles for flaunting virtuosity, not portraits. But the veil and flowers do suggest that she’s a virgin about to be married. In many European cultures, wreaths were worn by unmarried women and veils were symbols of new life—something about to be, well, unveiled.</p>

## Italy in disguise?
<p>One theory about the identity of veiled ladies is that they’re actually everyone, or at least every Italian. Created by Italian sculptors at a time when Italy was unifying, the veil and plain white color obscured regional differences like eye and skin color.</p>

## Factory of Ladies
<p>Raffaelo Monti was not a one-trick pony, but he became known for one trick in particular: the veiled lady. His workshop in Milan, Italy, produced a lot of them, the best-known being the <i>Veiled Vestal </i>commissioned for the Chatsworth House in Devonshire, England. Here, Keira Knightley marvels at it in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> (2005), filmed at Chatsworth.</p>
