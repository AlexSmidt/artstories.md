Summer in Kyoto can be painfully hot and humid, thanks to the surrounding mountains that trap humidity in the city. Before air conditioning, residents were drawn to the natural cooling of the Kamo River. Restaurants installed wooden platforms over the water for outdoor dining with all the usual indoor entertainment.

This is an everyday scene, but not an everyday painting. Utagawa Toyohiro typically focused on a few figures or a landscape in his paintings, but here presents a richer narrative driven by multiple dynamic interactions. Toyohiro made relatively few paintings and used woodblock printing to make them more available and affordable for the masses.

## Summer in the City

The Japanese word *nōryō* means "enjoying the cool evening." Restaurants in Kyoto still erect wooden platforms called* nōryō-yuka* over the Kamo River from May 1 to September 30, a popular local tradition. 

## Out for the Evening

A man and his companion enjoy lavish food and entertainment provided by *geisha *(female entertainers). The man wears a *yukata*, a casual cotton summer kimono, but the women are in full dress with at least three layers of fabric. 

## Full Service Fare

Besides a splendid platter of fish and side dishes, the restaurant provided a smoking set. The bamboo box holding the smoking set (*tabakobon*) is marked with the name of the restaurant, the Shojiya. 

## At Your Service

They're not just waitresses. The three women in plaid kimonos, red aprons, and green sashes are famous waitresses– some servers were well-known throughout Japan and, like geishas and courtesans, were portrayed in woodblock prints for their fans. 

## Let Us Entertain You

Elegant geishas provided entertainment to diners. Two on the left seem to be leaving, yielding the floor to two performers with stringed *shamisen*. 

## Taboo Touch

A demanding customer has created a stir by inappropriately grasping the wrist of a waitress holding a red *sakazuki*, a saucer for drinking sake. She physically recoils and shields herself with her free hand. 

## The Very Picture of Summer

Since dining on a Kyoto *nōryō –yuka*, or outdoor river platform was a quintessential summer activity, this painting was re-created as a woodblock print for a 12-month series issued in 1801.
