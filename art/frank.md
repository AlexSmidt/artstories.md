*Frank* is deceiving. From afar, the portrait looks like a larger-than-life photograph, but up close you discover that it’s paint on canvas. Chuck Close transformed an 8 x 10 inch photograph of his friend, Frank James, into a painting by dividing the photo into a grid pattern and copying it in large-scale on the canvas. Using only two tablespoons of diluted paint to cover the entire canvas, Close abandoned traditional brushes and used airbrushes, sponges, his fingers, razors, and even an eraser fastened to an electric drill. All of these tools were used to create the realistic finish, blemishes included, giving *Frank* a staggering amount of detail.

## Who is Frank?

Frank James was an art student at the School of Visual Arts in New York during the time that Close taught there. Close painted the portrait in his studio from a photograph he took of Frank.

## Familiar Face

Ironically, Close is unable to recognize faces as he suffers from prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness.  Painting portraits is a way for him to remember how to recognize a person’s face.

## Facial Features

Close tries to replicate how a camera or your eye would visually capture a face. If you look closely, Frank’s glasses and nose are in clear focus, while the neck, ears, and shirt gradually blur.

## Reflection on Glasses

The glasses reflect a view of the city from Close’s studio window and provide an entrance to a world beyond the painting.  His eyes offer a stoic, yet unassuming gaze that look over your shoulder.

## Larger Than Life

Starting as an 8 x 10 inch photograph, Chuck Close painted Frank’s head ten times its original photo size.  The large-scale rendering of Frank’s steady stare can be a little unsettling.
