Glorifying new buildings with slick exteriors, uplifting gardens, and heroic sculptures are in the best interests of real estate developers. It sells a positive image of the neighborhood!  So it takes a brave one to feature a photograph of a historic riot in the neighbood as a gigantic photomural for the atrium of a new building complex meant to revitalize that part of town.  But that is the story behind this photograph, Abbott and Cordova. A developer commissioned one of Canada's most famous artists, Stan Douglas, this monumental photograph.  

Douglas spent \$500,000 to restage a conflict that took place at the intersection of Abbott and Cordova in Vancouver on August 7, 1971 between young participants in a “smoke-in” supporting the legalization of marijuana and police.  This event reveals the period’s social unrest, as a new middle class, represented as well-dressed onlookers in the picture’s margins, began to gentrify the city.

## History Painting?

Photographs tend to be small, typically measured in inches such as 4 x 5, 8 x 10 or 20 x 24.  Douglas's photograph, however, is frankly, gigantic at 6 x 9 feet.  It is the size of 19th century history painting, but the subject is very different While history painting celebrated a hero in ancient mythology, royalty or a military event, Douglas celebrates a moment in local history that features protestors supporting marijuana, overbearing police, and a privledged middle class.

## Multi-Narratives

The photograph depicts several isolated groups who represent different social types: the well-heeled middle class; marijuana supporting hippies: young teens,and drivers just passing through the neighborhood.  This is many moments in time, compressed and stilled into one so we can look closer at the event.

## Pics or It Didn’t Happen

The phrase, "pics or it didn't happen," might be the caption for *Abbott and Cordova, 7 August, 1971*. Douglas’s photograph celebrates this forgotten moment in local Vancouver history.  Its grandness proclaims: Look at what’s happening.  Remember it.  It is important.   Focusing on lost histories is a common subject in contemporary art.  Artist want to show us how received ways of seeing and thinking elide important moments of history.

## Bird’s Eye View

Look at where you are looking from.  You are high above the scene.  Douglas took the picture from a crane, a crane’s-eye view, but his intention seems to be a clear metaphory.  This is a powerful viewpoint, as though the viewer has the special ability to look back in time.
