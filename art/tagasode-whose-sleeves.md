Few of us would display artwork of our closets flung open. But then, few of us have clothes like this, sumptuous garments neatly hanging from lacquer racks— except one, carelessly thrown onto the lower rail. 

Such folding screens were used as decorative room dividers in castles, and usually not signed by the artist. Whoever owned these silk and cotton clothes, and the *koto* string instrument on the floor, likely led a life of art and refinement. And didn’t mind showing it, instead of a hawk or other lordly symbol.

## Wealth in the Wardrobe

A woman of the samurai class might accumulate an impressive collection of robes. The cut of a robe varied only according to their function, but the choice of surface decoration left plenty of room for individual expression. 

## All on the Surface

Elaborate tie-dye and embroidery techniques initially allowed fabric designers to emulate the designs woven into Chinese luxury silks, but soon became a uniquely Japanese art form known as *tsujigahana*.

## Personal Effects

The hanging amulet, the stringed *koto* on the floor, and the beauty of the wardrobe suggest the owner of these items is a woman of alluring refinement. 

## Fashion Plates

Japanese fahionistas of the Edo period poured over sample books of fabric designs, published frequently between 1666 and 1820, the way some people today devour fashion magazines. 

## One of a Pair

This screen was originally the right side of a pair. The partner screen likely depicted more clothes on racks or folded on the floor.
