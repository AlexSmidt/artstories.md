Below towering cliffs, a surging waterfall, and crooked pine trees sits a lonely riverside pavilion, its curtains drawn back. No one is around, though a boat is moored nearby. A bridge across the way connects to a path that disappears in heavy mist. The place is shrouded in mystery.

## Imagined Landscape

There aren't many (any?) mountains like this one in Japan. The inspiration for this concocted landscape was instead almost certainly China. 

## Shigajiku

This work is an example of *shigajiku*, scroll (*jiku*) brushed with poems (*shi*) and paintings (*ga*). *Shigajiku *are collaborative projects involving a painter and typically several inscribers, usually Zen priests. 

## Which Came First?

Two poems about life on the river have been brushed onto the painting. But which came first– did the painting inspire the poems or was the painting created to illustrate the poems?

## Hermit-scholar

Japanese and Chinese landscapes are usually populated with reclusive scholars who roam mountain paths, gaze at waterfalls, or relax in riverside pavilions. But this painting leaves only clues to the scholar's presence: a moored boat and a pavilion with an open curtain. 

## Bridge to Nowhere?

Scholars need paths to roam, and so do we: The trails and bridges of East Asian landscape paintings give our eyes something to follow. 

## Sesshū

The heavy outlines, sharp contrast of black ink and bare white paper, and "moss dots" that seem to float around the edge of jagged rocks are all reminiscent of landscapes by the master painter Sesshū, active about a hundred years earlier but hugely influential in Shutoku's day. 

## “Shūtoku”

The seal at lower left reads "Shūtoku," but this painter's identity has long been a mystery. There may, in fact, have been two wholly separate painters named "Shūtoku" who were active in the mid-1500s.
