This sculpture is pure math. It’s an answer to a geometric riddle: How many ways can you form a cube without at least one of its edges? That’s a complicated question even for mathematicians. LeWitt set out to solve it visually, raising fundamental questions about the very nature of art along the way.

## Pure Form

Each 4-by-4-inch aluminum bar connects at a right angle and is coated with a flat white enamel, similar to automobile paint. Without visible seams, welds, or brushstrokes, LeWitt’s sculpture looks machine-made.

## Floored

Where’s the pedestal? This sculpture sits right on the floor, away from the wall—easier to walk around and encounter directly. LeWitt intended the presentation to be humble and accessible, avoiding the distance created by monuments and older sculptural traditions of being “put on a pedestal.”

## Missing Links

Mathematicians believe there are 122 possible variations of the Incomplete Cube problem. LeWitt obsessed over this mathematical puzzle and produced all of the variations in a variety of formats, from drawings, photographs, and small-scale models to large-scale models like the piece here.

## Structures, Not Sculptures

LeWitt sought to “remove the skin altogether and reveal the structure” of a cube with his open forms. He preferred the term “structures” instead of “sculptures” to describe his three-dimensional work.

## Black or White?

LeWitt chose white for his open cubes because he wanted a color that would be unobtrusive and free of associations—literally blank. Black, he felt, was too emotionally expressive.
