You may be in an art museum, but this sculpture is all about mathematics. It’s part of the answer to the question, “How many ways are there to form a cube missing at least one of its edges?” That’s a complicated question even for mathematicians. Sol LeWitt set out to solve it visually, raising fundamental questions about the very nature of art along the way.

## Pure Form

Each four-by-four inch aluminum bar is connected at right angles and coated with a flat white enamel similar to automobile paint. Without visible seams, welds or brushstrokes, LeWitt’s sculpture looks machine-made.

## Floored

Where’s the pedestal? *Incomplete Open Cube* sits right on the floor, away from the wall, so that it is easier to walk around and encounter directly. LeWitt intended the presentation to be humble and accessible, avoiding the distance created by monuments and older sculptural traditions.

## Missing Links

Mathematicians confirm that there are 122 possible variations of the *Incomplete Cube* problem. LeWitt obsessed over this mathematic puzzle and produced all of the variations in a variety of formats, from drawings, photographs, and small-scale models to large-scale models like the piece here.

## Structures, not Sculptures

LeWitt set out to “remove the skin altogether and reveal the structure” of a cube with his open forms. He preferred the term “structures” instead of “sculptures” to describe his three-dimensional work.

## Black or White?

LeWitt chose white for his open cubes because he wanted a color that would be unobtrusive and free of associations. Black, he felt, was too emotionally expressive.
