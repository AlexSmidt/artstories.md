Who wouldn’t want to join this serene party of poets? This idealized scene of a real literary gathering of Chinese scholar-officials that took place at Lanting, the Orchid Pavilion, was carved from a jade boulder—the largest piece of carved jade from the Qing dynasty outside of China. It was commissioned by Emperor Qianlong, who reigned from 1736–95 and whose own poem is carved into the back. The front bears the Lanting jixu (“Preface to the Poems Composed at the Orchid Pavilion") by Wang Xizhi, perhaps the greatest calligrapher of the Far East.

## Poetic Gathering

The famous convening of scholar-officials in 353 happened during the annual Spring Purification Festival, when cleansing rituals would be performed to prevent disease. Wang Xizhi gathered the group at the Orchid Pavilion in the eastern Chinese city of Shaoxing. They held a literary drinking contest: wine cups were floated down a small winding creek; whenever a cup stopped, the man closest to the cup was required to empty it and write a poem. 

## The Calligraphy

By the end of the event, 26 participants had composed 37 poems. Wang Xizhi was asked to write a preface to the collection. Written in semi-cursive script, it ranks as one of the world’s best-known and most-copied works of literature.

## Spirit of Jade Mountain

Jade carving offered another outlet for the Chinese love of mountains, which they associate with the tranquility and harmony of otherworldliness and the longing of the cultivated individual to escape the mundane world to commune with nature.

## Three Dimensional Landscape

The jade mountain takes the familiar Chinese landscape painting into three dimensions. And just like a painted landscape, the emperor marked the mountain with his seal and a poem of his own.
