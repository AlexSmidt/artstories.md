<p>This is no mere mat. It is a portable mosque. Like a mosque, this mat functions as a sacred space for prayer. A faithful Muslim prays five times a day: at dawn, noon, afternoon, sunset, and evening. Because going to a mosque to pray five times a day is not always possible, prayer mats were designed for the worshipper on the go.  The three spires in the center of the mat are a reference to Islamic architecture, and associate the mat with the mosque.</p>n

## Mihrāb
<p>The shapes on this prayer mat might remind some people of skyscrapers, but they are actually a <i>mihrāb</i>, one of the central features of an Islamic mosque. In the shape of a spire, the <i>mihrāb</i> literally points to the heavens. The <i>mihrāb</i> is also built into the wall that directly faces Mecca, the Saudi Arabian city of Mohammad’s birth and the site of the yearly <i>hajj </i>pilgrimage. During prayer, Muslims around the world face Mecca, which is easily done in a mosque: simply face the <i>mihrāb</i>. As a reminder to face Mecca, the shape of a <i>mihrāb </i>is often woven into prayer mats.</p>n

## Long Lost Twin
<p>This prayer mat was separated at birth from its identical twin, and the proof is that the fringe at the top is different from the fringe at the bottom. Here’s why: efficient weavers would create a mat with one half being a mirror image of the other, like butterfly wings, then cut it down the middle to create two identical mats. The cut edge naturally unraveled into the short fringe you see at the top.</p>n

## Stripes
<p>The pattern on this prayer mat might seem simple enough. Colorful stripes like these decorate fabrics across Madagascar. But if you are from Madagascar you know that local patterns vary by color, width, and number of stripes. Patterns went in and out of fashion over time and individual communities typically adopted one or two favorites.  Like a musician with a well-known folk song, skillful weavers replicated patterns and improvised on them; they knew what was central to the design and what was open to modification.</p>n

## Raffia
<p>Fabric made from cotton plants or wool is very familiar, but Sakalava women work with raffia, a fiber obtained from the leaves of the raffia palm. Tender palm leaves are harvested, dried, scraped and combed into long, fine threads. The threads are knotted together to create a continuous yarn, roughly the texture of crisp linen.</p>n
