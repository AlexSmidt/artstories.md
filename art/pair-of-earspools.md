You wouldn’t wear these earrings to the gym. In fact you wouldn’t wear these elaborate golden ear spools at all unless you were a Chimu ruler, and then only for public appearances around your vast empire in the coastal desert of northern Peru. The artist who made them used sophisticated metalworking techniques to create varied textures, concave and convex surfaces, and dangling discs, the better to shimmer in the hot sun as the ruler paraded with them in his impressively stretched earlobes.

## Royal Procession

In the center of each ear spool, the artist sculpted a miniature scene of the ruler with his royal entourage. The omnipotent king is the largest of the bunch, of course, and smack dab in the middle.

## Dressed to Impress

The ruler and his two primary attendants distinguish themselves in crescent-shaped headdresses that you wouldn’t find at the local clothing mart. The ruler also has a ceremonial cup of *chicha* (corn beer) in his left hand and a fan of exotic Amazonian bird feathers in his right.

## Monkey Attendants

Escorting the ruler’s caravan was apparently monkey business—those attendants flanking the ruler are indeed sharply dressed simians.
