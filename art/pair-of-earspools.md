These are not your everyday earrings. A Chimu ruler wore these elaborate, golden ear spools in his impressively stretched earlobes during public appearances around his vast empire in the coastal desert of northern Peru. An artist, through his command of sophisticated metalworking techniques, created varied textures, concave and convex surfaces and dangling discs, resulting in shimmering display as the ruler paraded processed in the hot sun.

## Royal Procession

In the center of each ear spool, the artist sculpted a miniature scene of the ruler with his royal entourage. The all-important king is the largest of the bunch. And, of course, he’s positioned smack dab in the middle.

## Monkey Attendants

The attendants flanking the ruler are in fact monkeys.  While still elaborately dressed, they stand to the side of the ruler and hold steady the caravan on which he rides.

## Dressed to Impress

The ruler and his two primary attendants distinguish themselves in crescent-shaped headdresses that you wouldn’t find at the local clothing mart. The ruler also has a ceremonial cup of chicha (corn beer) in his left hand and a fan of exotic Amazonian bird feathers in his right.
