Gleaming gold, luscious rubies, ornately cast designs and figures—who wouldn’t want to wear this fabulous necklace? It was once destined for the very wealthy neck of either a Brahmin priest or a Chettiar merchant, (the Chettiars are historically a business community with ties to the region of Tamil Nadu), who would have worn it on his 60th birthday. The large reddish-brown beads are seeds from the Rudraksha tree, which is associated with the god Shiva, and are prized for their auspicious properties said to bring wealth, health, and a change of fate to their owners. The golden figures are all associated with the god Shiva, connecting the wearer to his holy presence.

## Rudraksha Beads

Rudra is another name for Shiva, and *aksha* refers to the eye. Legend has it that after a long period of meditation, Shiva cried a single tear, giving life to the Rudraksha tree. Fresh rudraksha berries are bright blue and eventually dry out to become the ridged beads used in necklaces. Rudraksha necklaces are also called rudrakshamala (garland of rudraksha).

## Shiva and Parvati (Umamahesvara)

The central amulet depicts the gods Shiva and Parvati seated on Shiva’s bull mount.  They sit beneath the gateway of a south Indian temple (*gopuram*), and are flanked by their two sons, the elephant-faced Ganesha and Murugan, who rides a peacock.  

## Creative Creatures

A host of fantastic creatures populate the main amulet. A dwarf holds up Shiva’s bull, which is flanked by two leaping lions while a pair of celestial deities (*apsaras*) flies overhead. Twin *makaras* (mythical aquatic creatures) are in each corner, and a filigree depicting peacocks and floral motifs frames the amulet. 

## A Portable Shrine

The bottom amulet opens and might have contained a miniature lingam (a symbol of Shiva) or sacred ash, allowing the necklace to double as a portable shrine. A row of lingams appears at the bottom and is surrounded by rubies.

## Jewels

The amount of jewel work is extraordinary, with no less than 42 inset rubies and semiprecious green jewels. 

## Goddess Clasp

Indian artisans traditionally adorn works of art, both big and small, with intricate and hidden details. Though this clasp would have been somewhat obscured by the wearer’s neck, it is adorned by the goddess Kaumari, the female counterpart of the god Murugan, who rides a peacock mount. She is flanked by two female attendants.
