He has taken their clothes and stuffed them in a bag under his arm. But it’s not what you think. He needs the beautiful fairies’ assistance, and is holding their clothes until they agree to help, an action which is a common trope from South Asian literature and religious mythology. King Raja Bikram, as depicted in this scene from a *Gulshan-i ‘Ishq* manuscript, has been unable to bear a child with his queen. So he’s on a journey to find a solution. Finding the winged fairies, he demands that they take him to see a holy man, who ultimately gives Bikram a magic, pregnancy-inducing fruit.

## Bodies in Water

The artist used thin lines of silver to depict the sprays and swirls of a fountain, then coyly placed the fairies underwater. He suggested their nudity by painting faint outlines of their bodies beneath the ripples. Look carefully and you’ll discover they’re not alone, sharing the pool with fish.

## A Blossoming Garden

Numerous kinds of fruit trees, blossoming flowers, and animals, from squirrels to parrots, evoke an environment of vitality and the beauty of variety.

## Delicate Details

The artist used a fine brush, sometimes the width of a single hair, to apply exquisite details to the figures, like the red henna on the hands on the fairies and the dampness of their long hair. Their necklaces, pearl earrings, gold bracelets, and even nose rings are all clearly visible.

## Gold Accents

The artist used gold to highlight details and to animate the composition—make it come alive with gleaming vitality. He applied it to the painting then chiseled and pricked it to better bounce light and catch the eye.

## Urdu Poetry

Rhymed couplets on the back of the painting are written in Dakani Urdu, a language that incorporates elements of Persian, Arabic, Sanskrit, and Indian regional languages, attesting to the cosmopolitan nature of the Deccani courts.
