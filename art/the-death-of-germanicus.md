The ailing Germanicus—born Nero Claudius Drusus—earned his honorary name as a tenacious Roman general, famed for his brutally successful campaigns in the early first century against the tribes of Germania. He inspired such loyalty among his troops and the citizens of Rome that his adoptive father, the Emperor Tiberius, dispatched him to a distant post in Syria. The general’s mysterious death at 34 fueled suspicions that Tiberius had him poisoned and sparked grief and anger across the Roman Empire. More than 1,500 years later, French painter Nicolas Poussin sought to stir those feelings anew, framed in the stoic restraint of the classical past.

## Echoes of the Past

Poussin modeled his dying Germanicus on the mythical Meleager, who was featured on ancient Roman stone coffins that the artist would have known. In fact, his figures crowd the front of the scene, as on the shallow carved face of a coffin.

## Family in Mourning

Germanicus’s grief-stricken wife, Agrippina, is surrounded by three of their six children and their nurse, the youngest ones shown as cherubic in their naked innocence. The boy in blue would become the vile emperor Caligula, known for his brutality and excess.

## Avenging a Friend

The dying Germanicus beseeches his friends to avenge his death, and a commander in gleaming armor takes him up on it, his upraised arm and pointed finger a sign of resolve.

## The Stages of Grief

Poussin’s grieving soldiers act out their emotions with their hands, arms, and faces. We see the full spectrum in the crowd: denial, anger, depression, and vengeance.
