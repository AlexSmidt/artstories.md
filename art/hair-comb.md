<p>To pull a comb like this through your hair was to sweep across cultures in a single gesture, a reflection of 19th-century Zanzibar, then the cosmopolitan capital of the Omani Emirate, host to a United States consul, and a bustling harbor to ships from around the world. The lucky Zanzibari woman who received it as a wedding gift undoubtedly identified as Swahili, a cultural melting pot stretching along the East African coast from Somalia to Mozambique, and parts of Madagascar, with roots in Africa, Arabia, Persia and India.</p>

## Gold
<p>This comb saw its share of tangled hair, but it was probably also ornamental. The textured gold inlay would have sparkled brilliantly in sunlight while the ivory gleamed against dark hair.</p>

## Ivory
<p>It’s a typical African comb: decorative, with long teeth spaced relatively far apart. But while most African combs are wooden, this one is made of ivory—Zanzibar was a major center of the East African ivory trade.</p>

## Wood
<p>These combs resemble the ivory comb in form but not material: they’re wooden, which is more typical for African combs.</p>
