It is a simple and small photograph, nearly life-size, taken from directly above.  A broken, bandless watch is isolated on a fabric backdrop.  A gray halo surrounds the watch, the slight depression from its weight creating a shadow. Its fragile hands have stopped.  The time is 11:02 a.m. 

                                                                                         

Tomatsu’s title, *Atomic Bomb Damage: Wristwatch Stopped at 11:02, August 9, 1945, Nagasaki,* tells the rest of the story.  Bombed three days after Hiroshima, Nagasaki and its residents are sometimes forgotten.  But some 60,000 to 80,000 civilians died in this shipbuilding and military port.

## A Thousand Words

Pictures may be worth a thousand words, but titles frame our first impressions.  Tamatsu’s title works in tandem with his image.  It is descriptive, direct, and definitive.  Which did you see first, picture or title?

## Artistic Control

Tomatsu, who began his career as a photojournalist, liked to tells stories through photographs that were often described as personal or poetic.  In other words, they were photographs that didn’t always tell a story in a straight-forward way.  Newspaper and magazine editors, however, often want familiar and uncomplicated pictures.  Tamatsu’s response was to start VIVO, an independent photo agency.  With VIVO, he had greater control over the pictures and stories that he created for media.

## Void

Artist Tomatsu chose to remove the watch from any other visual context and place it against a stark white background, its own weight creating any impressions in the continuity.  The watch, and the memories it conjures, seem to exist void of time and space and is placed as an eternal symbol of the lives lost in a single moment.

## The Watch

The watch in the photo was dug up just under half a mile from the epicenter of the explosion.  It’s now in the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum.
