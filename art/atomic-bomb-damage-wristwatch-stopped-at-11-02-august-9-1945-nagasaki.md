It is a simple, small photograph: a broken, bandless watch isolated on a fabric backdrop. A gray halo surrounds the watch, its own shadow. Its fragile hands have stopped. The time is 11:02 a.m. The title, Atomic Bomb Damage: Wristwatch Stopped at 11:02, August 9, 1945, Nagasaki, tells the rest of the story. Bombed three days after Hiroshima, Nagasaki and its residents are sometimes forgotten. But some 60,000 to 80,000 civilians died in this shipbuilding and military port, prompting Japan to surrender to the Allies five days later.

## A Thousand Words

Pictures may be worth a thousand words, as the saying goes, but titles frame our first impressions. Tamatsu’s title—descriptive, direct, and definitive—works in tandem with his image. Which did you see first, picture or title?

## Artistic Control

Tomatsu liked to tell personal or poetic stories through his photography. But the press preferred direct and uncomplicated images. So Tomatsu formed VIVO, an independent photo agency that gave him greater control over the pictures and stories he created for media.

## Into the Void

Tomatsu set the watch on a stark white background, without any visual context. The watch and the memories it conjures seem to exist outside of time and space, an eternal symbol of the lives lost in a single moment.

## The Watch

The watch in the photo was dug up just under half a mile from the epicenter of the explosion. It’s now in the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum.
