He was a master of the middle ground, solidly centering the action in the narrow strip between foreground and horizon. A gifted landscape artist, Jean-François Millet evokes the boundless space of the rural plains where he lived by squeezing into this space a flock of grazing sheep, a lone shepherd, a man driving a farm cart, and a row of thatched-roof houses among the lush green pastures. He began his professional career in Paris, exhibiting controversial large-scale paintings of peasants at the Salons. Later Millet moved his growing family to the small village of Barbizon joining an informal colony of artists drawn to the forest of Fontainebleau and its bucolic surroundings.

## Brought to Light

This is the village of Chailly-en-Bière, up the road from Millet's hamlet, where people came for baptisms, school, groceries, and mail. Millet's remarkably original technique, in which luminous touches of bright green, yellow, and pink create the effect of reflected light, was later admired by the Impressionists.

## Cemetery Dispute

Millet was buried in a cemetery near the Church of Chailly. He had railed against plans to demolish it: “These wretches actually intend to scatter the bones of their own families over the fields to make the potatoes grow! Oh, shameful and brutal hand of man!” Eventually the cemetery was moved—a tennis court stands where he was originally buried—and his remains wound up close to where he stood to depict this view of Chailly. 

## Why Pastel?

Millet's friend and agent, Alfred Sensier, suggested brighter drawings might appeal to collectors and improve sales. So Millet experimented with pastels, which was, well-suited to his interests in color and tone, light and shadow, and how they change with time and the seasons.

## First Sketch

In this preliminary graphite study, now in the Yale University Art Gallery, Millet left out most of the details that would appear in the middle ground of the final pastel and focused on the general outline of the town.

## St. Paul Tycoon

This pastel was among the last works purchased by James J. Hill, the Minnesota railroad magnate. It arrived in St. Paul in the spring of 1916, along with another Millet pastel, *Watermill at the Foot of a Mountain, Allier*, just weeks before Hill's death on May 29, 1916.
