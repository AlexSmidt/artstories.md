It’s as monumental as it is minimal. With his Protractor Series (1967–69), Stella sought to remove his own artistic expression to instead emphasize pure color and lines, pulsing with depth and illusion. He even used house paints to limit his ability to freely express color, using standard commercial pigments rather than custom shades he might have blended. The large slab canvas, hung without a frame, removed another layer of artistic convention, allowing viewers to see the work as an object as well as a painting.

## What is Tahkt-i-Sulayman?

During an extended trip to the Middle East in 1963, Stella was inspired by buildings and religious sites, including Tahkt-i-Sulayman. It’s an ancient circular shrine in West Azerbaijan, Iran, and means “Throne of Solomon.” Though Stella borrowed the name, he insisted there was no relationship between his painting and the location.

## Circles, Lines, and Tape

Stella’s complex and pristine compositions look mechanically rendered. In fact, he used a pencil, a straight edge, and a compass-like device he made himself to create perfect hemisphere segments. He stretched yards and yards of tape across the canvas to keep the edges sharp between lines while he painted.

## Pure Colors

Stella was an intuitive colorist but he never mixed his paints. Instead, he used house paint straight from the bucket and applied it in overlapping and intersecting lines. The pure colors travel over and through the canvas, but they never mix.

## Mystical Protractors

The half-moon shape of a protractor found its way into a series of paintings created by Stella. He was inspired by the circular shapes of ancient ruins he saw in the Middle East.
