“Tahkt-I-Sulayman Variation II” by Frank Stella is as monumental as it is minimal. By creating rainbow patterns throughout his Protractor Series (1967-69), Stella attempts to remove his own artistic expression from the work. All of the emphasis is on the overlapping color and alternating curved and straight lines that are painted onto the canvas. Stella’s painting pulses with depth and illusion through the sequential framing and breaking of each rainbow.  He used house paints to limit his ability to freely express color, using pigments that were mixed commercially for sale, rather than blended into custom shades by the artist. The use of a large slab canvas hung without a frame is essential to Stella’s work prompting the viewer to see this work as an object as well as a painting.

## What is Tahkt-i-Sulayman?

During an extended trip to the Middle East in 1963, Stella was inspired by some of the buildings and religious sites that he visited. *Tahkt-i-Sulayman*, which means “Throne of Solomon,” is an ancient circular shaped shrine located in West Azerbaijan, Iran. To add to the mystery, though the title is very specific, Stella insisted there is no relation between his painting and the location. 

## Circles, Lines, and Tape

Stella complex compositions of primary shapes and colors have a pristine finish that looks mechanically rendered. He used a pencil, protractor, and straight edge to create perfect hemisphere segments. When he started painting, yards and yards of tape we applied to the canvas to keep the sharp edges between lines.

## Color

Stella was an intuitive colorist but he never mixed his paints. The artist used colors that came directly from buckets of house paint and applied them in overlapping and intersecting lines. The pure colors travel over and through the canvas, but they never mix.

## Protractors

Stella worked on a series of paintings centered on the half-moon shape of a protractor.  He was inspired by circular shapes he saw while visiting ancient ruins in the Middle East.
