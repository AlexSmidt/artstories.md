Imagine you’re dead (sorry), and a crowd has gathered for your funeral. They will bear your body through the streets in a unique coffin built to herald your wealth, status, and community standing. Now here’s an important question: exactly what coffin design would you want them to choose as a symbol of your profession or personality? Perhaps a larger-than-life lobster, complete with antennae and claws? Hey, it’s your funeral.

## Rock Lobster

Sowah Kwei, the sculptor who made this coffin, draws inspiration for his handcrafted wooden coffins from sources ranging from pop culture to nature. The rock lobster, also known as the spiny lobster, is characterized by its jointed external skeleton, long antennae, and spiny feelers and torso.

## Inside

When it comes to the funerals of loved ones, Ga families spare no expense. The coffin is hand-carved and painted, then lined with blue and white silk, all of this costing as much as two months salary. The Ga people believe a deceased person’s spirit must be given the proper funeral rites, especially since ancestors have the ability to influence their living relatives’ health and wellbeing—for better or worse—from the grave.

## Artist's signature

The Ga coffin craze began in the 1950s, when Kane Kwei started making quirky coffins in his workshop in Accra, Ghana: eagles, chili peppers, beer cans, bananas, pianos, and cars. Sowah Kwei followed in his father’s footsteps, making this coffin in 1993. Coffin shapes are personalized for their eternal occupants, and a lobster would be an appropriate choice for, say, a fisherman. Coffin makers began making two identical coffins, one for local burial and one for the national and especially international art market. The MIA’s coffin is of the latter sort.
