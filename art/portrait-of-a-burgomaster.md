You can tell this man is rich by the wealth he’s literally wearing on his sleeves: metal lace handmade from threads worth their weight in gold and silver. It was the most expensive part of his lavish clothing. In fact, lace like this is hard to find now because it was often melted down to make new lace in the latest pattern or converted back into currency.

Such finery created controversy in Calvinist Holland, where Protestant preachers advocated simple, thoughtful living. Removing precious resources from circulation in the name of vanity wasn’t what they had in mind. Some countries, though not the Netherlands, did actually outlaw metallic trimmings during economic crises.

## Status Sword

In this day and age swords were worn largely to convey rank and status, not for combat. Here, a looped pile of gold thread decorates the sash of the sword, its handle just visible below the left hand.

## Ribbon Trim

There are yards of costly looped silk ribbon trim embellishing the wrists and shoulder. The bunch on the shoulder actually had a legitimate purpose: keeping the sword sash from falling—the forerunner of today’s military epaulet.

## Unknown Sitter

We don’t know the sitter, but we can guess his position and personality. Obviously affluent, a little flamboyant, he made some concession to Protestant modesty by wearing a simple black suit. He might have been a Burgomaster, the Dutch term for a city leader.
