Many decades now separate these men from us. But their transfixed gazes seem to fill that void in time. Bunched together, like a team, they steady themselves, some balancing a hand on barbed wire, in confident poses that belie their brutal experiences. “Survivors gaze at photographer Margaret Bourke-White and rescuers from the United States Third Army during the liberation of Buchenwald, April, 1945,” read the caption when this photograph finally appeared in *LIFE* magazine on December 26, 1960, some 15 years after it was created. Today it remains one of the most widely circulated images of all time, picture of survival and a future.

## The First Camp

On the morning of April 11, 1945, *LIFE* magazine photographer Margaret Bourke-White accompanied the legendary General George Patton and his Third Army troops into the concentration camp at Buchenwald. The was the first such camp seen by the Americans, and Bourke-White would provide the first images. 

## 1945 versus 1960

*LIFE* didn’t publish *The Living Dead at Buchenwald* in its April 1945 issue, when the camp was liberated. Instead, the editors sought to shock the public with unvarnished reality, to make them witnesses of Hitler’s brutality, running pictures of crushed heads, emaciated prisoners, and piles of rotting bodies. When the photograph did appear, in the December 26, 1960, double issue, “25 Years of LIFE,” it was featured as one of the magazine’s top 100 photographs. Fifteen years after the fact, it was time for a more hopeful image of the past: the survivors. 

## Beauty over Barbarism

This photograph offers no sense of Buchenwald, the place. The concentration camp sits on a hill, surrounded by a lush green forest. It is a little more than a mile north of Weimar, the cradle of modern Germany, where the old imperial form of government gave way to democracy after World War I. It was also the home of the Bauhaus design school.  

## Movie Flash

These prisoners look like character actors in a movie, their faces distinctive. Bourke-White used a flash to take the picture, giving it a crisp look and adding to its cinematic feel. 

## Still War Pictures

War journalists typically pride themselves on capturing the frenetic, violent action of war, using small hand-held cameras that are easy to transport and shoot. There was little action, however, at Buchenwald. Bourke-White’s pictures were taken with a large-format camera that was bulky but captured greater detail—like the barbs on the wire and the numbers stitched onto clothing.
