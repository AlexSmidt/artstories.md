<p>She’s beautiful, of course. You can imagine the glint in her eye, the gleam of her lips, so realistic is this ceramic sculpture from nearly 900 years ago. In fact, in 1911, a German explorer in Africa couldn’t wrap his head around the possibility that Africans created it—it’s so different from the abstract art more typical of the continent—and instead proposed that Greek settlers had made it. We know better now, thanks to archaeology and oral history: royals in the ancient city of Ife, in present-day Nigeria, often hired artists to create life-like portraits like this in clay or bronze of themselves, friends, and family.</p>n

## Lines
<p>The vertical lines following the natural contours of the woman’s face have long been associated with scarification, the practice of cutting designs into the skin as marks of beauty and lineage.  But recent research suggests another interpretation: the lines may be shadows cast by the veiled royal crown worn in her day.</p>n

## Hairstyle
<p>It was a great era for hair stylists, who bent over backwards to come up with inventive looks like this headdress or hairstyle of seven parallel ridges. Other clay portrait heads from the same place and similar time demonstrate the importance of standing out from the crowd, starting from the top.</p>n
