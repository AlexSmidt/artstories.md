<p>How is brewing beer like growing babies? The Zulu believe the same ancestral forces that ferment beer also create children in the womb. Zulu families will drink beer together and ask their ancestors to help grow the brood. Round, shiny black pots like this one are at the center of Zulu beer parties, refreshing the living while linking them to past family ancestors.</p>

## Pot Top
<p>There’s a good reason the pot’s patterns are concentrated near the top. During beer parties, the pot sits on the ground, forging a connection between the drinkers and the ancestors who reside in the earth.</p>

## Spirits
<p>In Zulu culture, spirits are believed to like dark, shadowy things, so the pot’s glossy black surface is a kind of invitation: spirits, join the party.</p>

## Arcs
<p>Arcs are associated with women and the moon. As the moon waxes and wanes, so, too, do women’s bodies as they become pregnant and give birth to healthy children.</p>

## Shields
<p>These hourglass shapes likely refer to the shields that young Zulu men carry when they are old enough to marry. The shields are actually oval, but are often carried with a spear and a knobbed stick crossed behind them, creating an hourglass form.</p>

## Leaves
<p>These leaf-like shapes may represent certain medicinal herbs believed by the Zulu to ensure pregnancy. The roots of the Gopo Berry (<i>Phytolacca dodecandra</i>) are used to treat infertility.</p>
