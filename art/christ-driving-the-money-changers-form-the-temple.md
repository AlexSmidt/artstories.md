Justice is served as Jesus boots the people preying on pilgrims out of God’s house. The painter known as El Greco loved this scene from the Bible.*  And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those who sold doves. And He said to them, “It is written, my house shall be called a house of prayer; but you are making it a robber’s den.”* (Matthew 21:12) His multiple takes on the subject mark his evolving artistic style, each subsequent version being more abstract and stylized.

## The Dove Seller

The Old Testament of the Bible mandated a temple sacrifice: “Anyone who cannot afford a lamb is to bring two doves or two young pigeons to the Lord as a penalty for their sin.” Shrewd dove merchants saw an opening for sales, setting up shop right inside in the temple. Jesus saw exploitation.

## Jesus Gets Angry

In this biblical scene Jesus unleashes His righteous anger.  He brandishes a whip fashioned from cords to drive the ungodly merchants from the Temple. 

## Baby or Bacchus?

We can assume the reclining baby is not drinking apple juice. He’s been identified as Bacchus, the creator of wine and original party animal in Greco-Roman mythology. El Greco’s contemporaries sometimes portayed him as a tippling baby.

## Coins

In a fit of rage, Jesus dumped the money changers’ tables, resulting in the upturned strongbox and golden coins spilled onto the floor.

## Jerusalem or Venice?

The temple is in Jerusalem, but El Greco gives the interior of an Italian church. Looking through the arch, we see what visitors to Venice would have seen in El Greco’s day.  

## Mystery Men

Jesus had nothing against the four men huddled in the corner, Renaissance artists making cameo appearances. From left to right: Titian, Michelangelo, Giulio Clovio (an accomplished miniaturist and manuscript illuminator as well as El Greco’s friend), and Raphael. It’s a kind of credit, since their works and styles are reflected in this painting.

## Artists Cut

The four artists were once cut out of the painting, then later replaced, as seen through infrared imagery. An artistic edit? It’s a mystery.
