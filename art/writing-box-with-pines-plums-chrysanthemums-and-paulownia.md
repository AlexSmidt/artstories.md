Too good to use. Just like your mother’s china, this lacquer writing box (*suzuribaku*) was a status symbol for display, more valued for its looks than its utility. Inside, it held an inkstone and inkstick, a water dropper, and brushes, though we don’t know how often they really would have been used. Some writing boxes display the family crests of their owners, and although this one provides no such clues we can be sure the owner treasured it.

## Fabulous Foliage

The stylized pine trees on this box capture the tufted shape of real Japanese pines. 

## Plum Tree Blossom

The distinctive five-petal flower shape identifies these flowers as plum tree blossoms. 

## Chrysanthemum

The globe-like chrysanthemum flower is rendered as a stylized circle in this lacquer box. 

## Empress Tree

*Paulownia tomentosa*, commonly known as the empress tree or princess tree, is a fast-growing native of central and western China. Its presence on this box demonstrates the great influence of China on Japanese art. 

## Lightning in a Box

Writing boxes from the Momoyama-period (1573-1615) are recognizable for their bold designs, such as this lightning bolt shape that dramatically divides the lid. 

## Sprinkled Picture

A popular decorating technique is maki-e, or sprinkled picture. Artists use a hollow bamboo tube to carefully sprinkle metallic flakes or powder on damp lacquer.
