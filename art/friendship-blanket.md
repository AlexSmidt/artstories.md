From French silk ribbons, Italian glass beads, and an English woolen blanket comes this quintessentially Osage (Wazhazhe) kind of art: a Friendship Blanket. The Osage migrated west from the Ohio River valley to present-day Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas, and Oklahoma. And although they came across many imported materials, this never diluted their native aesthetics. Instead, they used these new items to enhance traditional designs and refine their techniques. Friendship blankets, as the name suggests, embody affection and connection, and are made as gifts. During a dance, the red hands gently sway back and forth—symbols of friendship.

## Layers of Meaning

Osage artists are famed around the world for their excellence in reverse applique, the design technique of cutting a top layer to reveal a shape in contrasting color underneath.

## Life as Tattoo

The designs in the ribbon work are based on ancient tattooed symbols that would be drawn from a woman’s shoulder down to her fingertips, representing life in all its forms. Creating this particular applique design was so challenging that only the most masterful ribbon-work artists would attempt it.

## In Living Color

The colors used in Osage art are deeply symbolic—of goodness, in the case of this blanket. Red and yellow represent the rays of sun and life-giving properties, blue corresponds to clarity and power, and green means the earth and the breath of life itself.

## Wool from Britain

When traders arrived in America with Stroudcloth—wool made in the town of Stroud in Gloucestershire County, England—it quickly became the preferred material for fashioning garments and blankets.
