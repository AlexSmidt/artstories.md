He dances wildly, his left leg lifting in a powerful, graceful gesture and his arms swaying elegantly across his body. This is the god Shiva in his Nataraja form, the embodiment of his supreme powers. The sculpture is the MIA’s first donated work of Indian art and one of the cornerstones of the collection. Ancient texts speak of Shiva’s dance, *ananda tandava* (literally translated as “furious bliss”), as wreaking havoc and destruction—sending false prophets scampering and humiliating rival gods and goddesses.

## Demon or Dwarf

Shiva stands on the back of a fat, child-like creature clutching a snake. The creature’s identity is still debated. Some scholars believe it represents a dwarf, which turns up in early texts as an assistant to Shiva’s dance. Others argue it is a vanquished demon, named Apasmara or Mushalagan, that personifies ignorance.

## Holy Hair

Shiva sports an impressive updo. The topknot is decorated with crane feathers and a cluster of spiky leaves from the wild cassia (kondrai) plant. His dreadlocks, worn by some Hindu holy men and women, are adorned with his sacred flower (the datura), a seated woman personifying the Ganges River, and a crescent moon.  

## Goddess Ganga

The goddess Ganga is a personification of the Ganges, India’s most sacred river. Her body is half-human and half-snake, features which characterize many divine half-human, half-snake creatures (nagas and naginis) that dwell in the waters of Indic mythology. Shiva offered to receive the mighty river into his dreadlocks so that her descent would not destroy the earth, and he gently placed his dreadlocks on the earth.

## Right Side

There is no single reason for Shiva’s four arms, but multiple arms typically suggest a god’s immense power, and the ability to perform many tasks at once. Typically, four arms indicate a god in a beneficient attitude, while multiple arms portray an active, warlike mode. In one hand, Shiva holds a damaru drum, emitting what some experts interpret as the rhythmic sound of creation. In another, he makes the abhaya mudra, a gesture of protection from evil.

## Ball of Fire

Shiva holds a ball of fire in his upper left hand, which he can hurl at his enemies. Or it may allude to the cremation grounds where he dances.

## A Godly Face

Shiva wears two different earrings, symbolizing the union of male and female. In his left ear, he wears a large circular ring of the sort generally worn by women, and in his right ear a lion or aquatic creature (makara). According to myth, the ubiquitous vertical third eye opened when his wife, Parvati, covered his two eyes in jest, unintentionally flooding the earth with darkness.

## Ring of Fire

This Shiva Nataraja would have been encircled by a now-lost ring of flames that emphasized the dance’s destruction.
