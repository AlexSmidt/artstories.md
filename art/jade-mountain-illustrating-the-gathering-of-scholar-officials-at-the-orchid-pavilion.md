Who wouldn’t want to join this serene party of poets? This idealized scene of a real literary gathering of Chinese scholar-officials that tooke place at Lanting, the Orchid Pavilion, was carved from a jade boulder—the largest piece of carved jade from the Qing dynasty outside of China. It was commissioned by Emperor Qianlong, who reigned from 1736–95 and whose own poem is carved into the back. The front bears the Lanting jixu (“Preface to the Poems Composed at the Orchid Pavilion") by Wang Xizhi, perhaps the greatest calligrapher of the Far East.
