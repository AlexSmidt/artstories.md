“Tying the knot” is shorthand around the world for getting hitched, taking the plunge—getting married. But in Somali weddings, at least, it was taken literally: women of the bride’s family made baskets like these and filled them with gifts and food. But one had a twist: it was tied with an impenetrable web of knots, and men from the groom’s family took turns trying to open it. Failure meant having to dance, sing, or otherwise entertain the bride. The groom was ultimately expected to win, but untying the knot didn’t symbolize the marriage coming apart. In fact, just the opposite.

## Bead Pattern

The beads on this basket most likely came from Europe. The “interlock” pattern on this basket is particularly sumptuous. It’s a design also found on carved spoons and neckrests from Somalia.

## Color

The fiber used to weave the basket was dyed to match the color of the beads.

## Sweets

When the basket is presented to the married couple, it contains a sweet and savory mixture of preserved meat and dates. The preserved meat is traditionally made with camel meat. It is seasoned, then cooked or dried, and stored in oil to preserve it. The dates are mashed into a paste, spiced, and rolled into small balls.
