Does this look like a plan for a grand university building, a government palace, or some part of the Vatican? More to the point, does it look anything like Mia? It was supposed to. The architectural firm of McKim, Mead and White built the model after winning the 1911 competition sponsored by the Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts (the parent organization of Mia), and its ambition reflects the Society’s plans for a cultural center, or Institute of Arts, including not just a museum but an art school and orchestra hall. Only a fraction of it was built.

## Monumental Entrance

Mia’s front entrance recalls an ancient Greek or Roman temple, with the triangular pediment sitting atop Ionic columns to form a porch, or portico. The entrance closely mirrors the depiction of the entrance on the model.

## A Musical Wing

The Society also wanted to incorporate an Orchestra Hall to house the Minneapolis Symphony (you can peek into the balconies on the model, since part of it has no roof). The wing was never built, however, and the Orchestra performed at Northrop Auditorium on the University of Minnesota campus until the construction of Orchestra Hall in 1974.

## Sculptures for Study

The wing to the left of the main entrance was to house a Sculpture Hall. Filled with reproductions of famous sculptures, it would have been inspirational for students in the art school, also included in this wing. The school was briefly housed in Mia, but funds were soon raised for a separate building. In 1970, the Minneapolis School of Art became the independent Minneapolis College of Art and Design—MCAD.

## Model for Money

The model was a particularly evocative fundraising tool. Potential donors could picture what their donation would support. The handles on the sides allowed people to pull it apart and examine it more closely.

## Original Plan on Paper

For the competition, the architects included a set of drawings of the different views of the building and its site. An elevation drawing shows the side of a building—this one shows the front entrance.
