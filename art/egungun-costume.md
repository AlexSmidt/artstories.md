<p>The true power and purpose of this Egungun costume is revealed only by motion. Swaying and twirling to the beat of a battalion of drums, an Egungun dancer communicates with ancestors, who play key roles in the Yoruba community long after they’ve passed on. Egungun ceremonies both honor the ancestors and call on them to protect their descendants from danger and misfortune, defend the good name of the community, and reinforce morals and laws. So deep is this communication that the performance is said to temporarily transform the dancer into his ancestors.</p>n

## Framework
<p>A costume this imposing needs a framework not unlike a tent: a sturdy wooden support beam running along the top that the dancer actually balances on his head. The dancer can then parade around town, twisting and twirling. To wear this heavy costume in the hot tropical sun, sometimes for several hours at a stretch, is an incredible display of dedication and endurance.</p>n

## Aso oke Cloth
<p>It may be mostly hidden, but the base of the costume is the most important part. This base of colorful <i>ankara</i>, a popular West African cloth often referred to as Dutch wax print, is lined with handmade indigo and white <i>aso oke</i> cloth—a fabric often used for burial shrouds. That the <i>aso oke</i> cloth is worn so close to the dancer’s body is a symbol of his connection with the dead.</p>n

## Face
<p>A costumed Egungun dancer peers out through this window of knotted fiber, a dense net that works like the advertising wrapped around buses—dotted with tiny holes so that the dancer can see out but it’s impossible for onlookers to see in.</p>n

## Materials
<p>The overlapping flaps of the costume, called lappets, are made of lavish brocades, lush velvets, and exotic embroidered silks—materials so luxurious they let the ancestors know they’re still valued. And ancestors who feel valued can be a powerful asset, as they watch over and protect the living.</p>n

## Lappets
<p>The overlapping panels of the costume, called lappets, fly up and out while the dancer whirls, providing a “breeze of blessing” to the crowd. They also relate family history, with the lappets closest to the heart of the costume being the oldest and each subsequent generation adding their own using the fabrics of the moment. Here, lappets made from antique brocades and velvets hang beside those of Lurex-striped fabric fringed with plastic.</p>n

## Shine-Shine
<p>These spangles, sparkling in the sunlight, are cut, shaped, and punched from thin aluminum sheets sold specifically for Egungun costumes. The dazzling effects date to the mid-20th-century aesthetic called “Shine-Shine.” Costumes like this, dating to the 1930s or1940s, are now considered old-fashioned. Newer Egungun costumes are sometimes created entirely from metallic fabrics, satins, sequins, and spangles.</p>n
