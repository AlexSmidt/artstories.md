Gentle, calm, benign—he is a divinity of mercy and compassion, bodhisattava Avalokitesvara or Guanyin. He was carved for a temple during one of the most creative epochs of Chinese Buddhist sculpture, around 1100 to 1200, and expresses the new humanism of the day. Splendidly attired and seated in the cross-legged “lotus” position suggesting tranquility and balance of thought, he beams the bliss of near-enlightenment.
