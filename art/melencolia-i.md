A magnificent angel broods while a dog sleeps at its feet and a chubby child—a *putto*—sits on a millstone, scribbling away on a tablet. We may never know what this all means, but it certainly touches on many of Dürer’s interests: the artist as creator, mathematics, and the relationships between the physical, intellectual, and spiritual realms. Little was written about it when he made it in 1514, though it became one of the most discussed works in the history of art, a manifesto on knowing the unknowable and making the unmakeable.

## What Is Melencolia?

Melencolia is a variant spelling of “melancholy,” which means sadness. It was once believed to result from an excess of a bodily fluid known as “black bile.” Our understanding of the body has changed since then, but today’s physicians would agree with their predecessors that depression is as much a chemical condition as it is emotional.

## Comet or Shooting Star

Unusual celestial events held ominous meanings in the 1500s. Dürer may have witnessed the atmospheric entry of a 250-pound meteorite on November 7, 1492. It landed about 30 miles from Basel, where he was at the time.

## Symbols of Mortality

The hourglass tells us that our time is running out. The bell will toll our death. The balance will weigh our souls to see if we are destined for heaven or hell.

## The Magic Square

The sum of the numbers in any row or column is the same as any other. Here they add up to 34, and other patterns of four work, too.

## What Is That Multi-Sided Block?

This shape, first recorded in Melencolia I, is called “Dürer’s Solid.” It has eight sides: six pentagons and two equilateral triangles. It can be derived from the grid of the Magic Square.

## Crucible

Alchemists used these containers to heat base metals such as lead in their attempts to turn them into gold.

## Tools: Worldy and Spiritual

Carpenters' tools litter the foreground, perhaps symbolizing the limits of physical creation. The aspergillum (at left) sprinkles holy water. The nails may allude to Christ. Will the clyster—an instrument used to administer an enema—relieve the angel's creative constipation?

## Dürer's Monogram

Dürer usually signed his work with a monogram. He used his first initial to make a stylized door or gate for that was the meaning of his surname.
