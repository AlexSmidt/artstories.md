A magnificent, laurel-crowned angel sits brooding. A dog sleeps at its feet and a putto sits on a millstone, scribbling away on a tablet. Above a distant horizon, a rainbow frames a streaking comet, while a bat-like creature flies through the sky holding a banner that reads “MELENCOLIA I.”

Little was written about Albrecht Dürer's image when he made it in 1514, but over time this mysterious print became one of the most frequently discussed images in the history of art. We may never know its full meaning but we can be certain that it touches upon many of the artist's central interests: the role of artist as creator, mathematics, and the relationships among the physical, intellectual, and spiritual realms. In essence the engraving became a manifesto on knowing the unknowable and making the unmakeable.

## What Is Melencolia?

Melencolia is a variant spelling of “melancholy,” which means sadness. It was believed to result from an excess of a bodily fluid known as “black bile.” Though understanding of the body has changed, today's physicians would agree with their predecessors that depression is as much a chemical as it is an emotional condition.

## Comet or Shooting Star

Unusual celestial events held ominous meanings in the 1500s. Dürer may have witnessed the atmospheric entry of a 250-pound meteorite on November 7, 1492. It landed about 30 miles from Basel, where he was at the time.

## Symbols of Mortality

The hourglass tells us that our time is running out. The bell will toll our death. The balance will weigh our souls to see if we are destined for heaven or hell.

## The Magic Square

The sum of the numbers in any row or column is the same as any other. Here they add up to 34, and other patterns of four work, too.

## What Is That Multi-Sided Block?

This shape, first recorded in Melencolia I, is called “Dürer’s Solid.” It has eight sides: six pentagons and two equilateral triangles. It can be derived from the grid of the Magic Square.

## Crucible

Alchemists used these containers to heat base metals such as lead in their attempts to turn them into gold.

## Tools: Worldy and Spiritual

Carpenters' tools litter the foreground, perhaps symbolizing the limits of physical creation. The aspergillum (at left) sprinkles holy water. The nails may allude to Christ. Will the clyster—an instrument used to administer an enema—relieve the angel's creative constipation?

## Dürer's Monogram

Dürer usually signed his work with a monogram. He used his first initial to make a stylized door or gate for that was the meaning of his surname.
