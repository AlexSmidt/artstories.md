How do you represent the trauma of history? A heavy question, indeed, and one that is typically answered with dreary and hard to watch images that tell us something that we already know about suffering.  Reflecting on the history of apartheid— the South African system of racial segregation that was the law of the land from 1948 to 1994—Kentridge’s animated video takes on a different, diaristic perspective on race relations.  It is serious, meditative, and yet hopeful.  He is in the middle of this history, walking as a cartoon character, through Cassell’s Cyclopaedia of Mechanics (1901).  It is an early how-to book, but Kentridge is clear that there are no simple formulas here, only change, as he makes, erases and remakes drawings.  These are punctuated with evocative texts: “All the Trees in the Library,” “Thinking on One’s Feet,” and “End with Love.”  \
 

Together, the drawings suggest death, memory, and hope, drawn from the artist’s personal experience of apartheid. The book’s pages turn, like the movement of time, to mournful music by South African composer Neo Muyanga.

## Stop Action

Second Hand Reading is made with hundreds of drawings. In what is called “stop action” filming, each drawing is filmed individually and then pieced together to give a sense of movement. Kentridge emphasizes a dramatic sense of change and transformation by showing erasures and redrawing in his film.  One might make the leap and say that this mirrors his optimism about the history of South Africa.

## Film as Art?

Kentridge was, at first, dedicated to drawing. Although he experimented with film, Kentridge needed to be convinced of the artistic value of the medium..

"When I first did the films they were very separate from my activity of drawing, which was art. And when a curator came and said he wanted to show my films, I felt insulted and I refused. I said, 'This is nonsense; they're not art, they're films. Here are the drawings, what's wrong with the drawings? Why don't you like the drawings? These are perfectly good drawings, what do you want the films for?'" 

## Art and Politics

While Kentridge’s art is figural, he’s not interested in merely illustrating South African history. Rather, the experience is communicated through his choice of materials, and other artistic decisions.\
\
“The political interest in what happens in South Africa is very much part of the work. When I started working as an artist, one of the questions that seemed inescapable to me was how one finds an adequate way (whether it's adequate or not is open to debate) of not initially illustrating a society that one lives in, but allows what happens there to be part of the work, the vocabulary, and the raw material that is dealt with." 

## The Megaphone

Megaphones “indicate what needs to be heard or seen, outside of oneself,” states artist William Kentridge.  A drawing of a megaphone emitting sound appears throughout the video, Second Hand Reading.  It has been a recurring motif since Kentridge’s first animate film, Monuments (1991)
