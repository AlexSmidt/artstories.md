Here’s a heavy question: How do you represent the trauma of history? The answer is usually uninspired: dreary, hard-to-watch images that don’t tell us anything new about suffering.  Kentridge was more original. His animated video is an unusual, diary-like take on race relations during apartheid, the South African system of racial segregation that was the law of the land from 1948 to 1994. It is serious and meditative, yet engaging and hopeful. As a cartoon character, he makes, erases, and remakes drawings within an old how-to book to emphasize that there are no formulas, only change. The book’s pages turn, like the movement of time, to mournful music by South African composer Neo Muyanga.

## Stop Action

Hundreds of drawings were photographed and pieced together by Kentridge to give a sense of movement—the “stop action” film technique. By showing erasures and redrawing, he emphasizes dramatic change, even an optimism about the possibility of transformation in South Africa.

## Film as Art?

Kentridge was dedicated to drawing at first, needing to be convinced of film’s artistic potential. "When I first did the films, they were very separate from my activity of drawing, which was art,” he says. “And when a curator came and said he wanted to show my films, I felt insulted and I refused. I said, 'This is nonsense; they're not art, they're films. Here are the drawings, what's wrong with the drawings? Why don't you like the drawings? These are perfectly good drawings, what do you want the films for?'" 

## Art and Politics

Kentridge is uninterested in merely illustrating South African history, instead relating his experiences under apartheid through his choice of materials and other artistic decisions. “When I started working as an artist,” he says, “one of the questions that seemed inescapable to me was how one finds an adequate way (whether it's adequate or not is open to debate) of not initially illustrating a society that one lives in, but allows what happens there to be part of the work, the vocabulary, and the raw material that is dealt with." 

## The Megaphone

Megaphones “indicate what needs to be heard or seen, outside of oneself,” Kentridge says.  A drawing of a megaphone emitting sound appears throughout the video, a recurring motif since Kentridge’s first animated film, *Monuments* (1991).
