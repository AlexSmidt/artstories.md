<p>It’s a rich millennia-old mystery: Why was a teenage girl named Tashat buried with the skull of an unknown adult between her legs? And why are so many of her bones broken? X-rays and CT scans also reveal a poorly embalmed body and missing funereal jewelry, raising questions about those who prepared Tashat for the afterlife.</p>

## Meet Tashat
<p>A shy smile, smooth cheeks, and full eyebrows—she’s a teenager all right, confirming the story told by the hieroglyphics on her wooden coffin: that she was between 15 and 19 years old when she died. And she probably looked much like this, since an accurately carved and painted portrait on her coffin would have helped her spirit, or <i>ka</i>, reunite with her body after death.</p>

## Lady of the House
<p>Though just a teenager, Tashat was a married woman—a “lady of the house,” according to these hieroglyphics. They also identify her as the daughter of the Doorkeeper of the Gold-House of Amon, an important temple in Thebes. His stature as supervisor of the temple’s treasury entitled her to a noble burial. <i></i></p>

## Light-Hearted
<p>A light-hearted person wasn’t just a metaphor for ancient Egyptians, who believed that bad deeds weighed heavily on the heart while a light heart meant a righteous earthly life and the right to immortality. Mummies like Tashat were embalmed with the heart intact, to be weighed in the underworld against the feather of Maat, the goddess of truth. In this painted likeness of Tashat, Maat appears in the center of her collar, the feather of judgment worn around her neck.<strong></strong></p>

## Osiris
<p>The green-skinned god of the underworld, wrapped in the red robe of a male mummy, was nothing to be afraid of—no devil or grim reaper. As god of the underworld, Osiris’s presence on coffins assured friends and family members that the dead would be welcomed into his kingdom.</p>

## Organ Jars
<p>Like most mummies, Tashat was her own organ donor. Her heart is still in her chest, but the rest of her internal organs were removed, dried, and stored in special jars—each protected by its own deity—for use by her spirit, or <i>ka</i>, in the afterlife.</p><p><em>From left to right:</em></p><ul><li>Jackal-headed Duamtef protects the stomach</li><li>Hawk-headed Qebehsenuf protects the intestines</li><li>Dog-headed Hapy protects the lungs</li><li>Human-headed Imset protects the liver</li></ul>

## The Case of the Missing Spine
<p>Most internal organs were removed from the body, but a mummy typically retained its skeleton. Tashat, however, is missing her spine. This would have presented some problems for her in the afterlife. The backbone was an important symbol of stability in ancient Egypt, painted on coffins in the form seen here as the <i>djed</i>. <i>Djed</i>-shaped amulets often placed near the spine of a mummy ensured that it would regain the use of its spine in the afterlife. Unfortunately, Tashat had to do without it.</p>

## Eye of Horus
<p>Horus was a good son, offering his left eye in exchange for restoring his father, Osiris, to eternal rule over the underworld. The “eye of Horus,” called <i>udjat</i>, is now a familiar symbol of protection and sacrifice and is painted on Tashat’s wrappings, or <i>cartonnage</i>. Like Horus, Tashat must offer Osiris her physical body in exchange for her spiritual life.</p>

## Mummy Detail
<p>Remember the curse of the mummy? According to legend, any person who disturbs a mummy is cursed with bad luck, illness, or even death. Hell-bent on revenge, the bandaged, moaning corpse will walk to the ends of the earth to enact its spooky justice.</p><p>Here we see the wrapped, walking mummy of Tashat. But instead of seeking revenge, she seeks immortality. On her way to meet Osiris, she is supported by the jackal-headed god Anubis, not to be confused with the jackal-headed Duamtef who protects a canopic jar containing the dead’s stomach.</p>

## Inside the Coffin
<p>Incredible images and inscriptions once decorated the inside of Tashat’s coffin, ancient artwork now hidden by a thick black substance. No, it’s (probably) not cursed. During mummification, Tashat’s body and wrappings may have been painted with a clear liquid, like resin, to prevent water damage. The resin was likely mixed with pitch (a sticky brown substance) for extra protection. Over time, the pitch seeped through the wrappings into the wooden coffin.</p>
