“Is he the worst artist in America?” So asked the title of a 1964 article about Roy Lichtenstein in *Life* magazine. It’s hard today to imagine how shocking his work appeared to audiences of the 1960s, taken aback by the low-brow subject matter and dubious of the artistry involved in copying a budget print job. But Lichtenstein was playing with heady issues that had preoccupied generations of artists before him—the shifting intersection between abstract form (lines and dots on canvas) and meaning (or lack thereof).

## All True Love Stories!

Trashy romance comics thrived alongside pulp fiction and radio soap operas from the 1940s through the mid-1970s. They appealed to Lichtenstein because their imagery seemed as far from “art” as an image could get.

## Mechanical Process, Done By Hand

Ben-Day dots, a technique for color printing using small colored dots, allowed printers to produce a wide range of effects on the cheap. Comic book artists used preprinted transfer sheets, but Lichtenstein simulated (and exaggerated) the effect by hand.

## What a Cliché!

The storyline of a romance comic is full of obvious clichés, but Lichtenstein was as interested in the visual clichés employed by comic book artists--the eyes, nose, and hair of pulp vixen followed a very particular formula.

## Copycat?

Many were scandalized that Lichtenstein could get away with “copying” a comic strip and call it art. In fact, the painter rarely copied a comic directly, but subtly altered the source image to heighten the clichés.
