They once formed the walls of the so-called “Bamboo Room,” a reception chamber in the Daikaku Temple in Kyoto. But they had disappeared from the temple long before the MIA acquired them. These 16 sliding screens depicting rice farming form a continuous agricultural panorama and were likely painted by Kanō Sanraku, who decorated other rooms in the temple around 1620. In 1755, they were given to the artist Ōoka Shunboku (1680–1763) in exchange for additional decorating work at the temple and were later combined into four four-panel screens. After the MIA acquired them in 1980, they were restored to their original format as sliding screens.

## A Look Around the Room

They were originally arranged as the four walls of a meeting room—four sliding screens per wall—each wall representing a season and linked to a direction. Winter corresponds to the north, spring to the east, summer to the south, and fall to the west.

## Rice Starter Bed

In winter, rice seedlings are planted tightly together in starter beds, where they grow until they’re planted in spring.

## Winter Plowing

The climate in Kyoto only allows for one rice crop to be planted and harvested each year. This screen depicts winter, when plows pulled by water buffalo readied fields for spring.

## Spring

In the spring, the rice seedlings are transferred by hand from the starter beds to the fields. Here, men are shown pulling out the weeds that compete with the growing rice.

## Raised Paths

The rice paddies are contained by elevated embankments that also serve as dry pathways for the rice farmers to walk from one field to another.

## Summer

The plants thrive in summer with the help of constant irrigation. Water is supplied via the “dragon’s backbone machine,” a type of chain pump—sometimes called a “water ladder”—that was developed in China. Operated by foot, pallets draw water from below through a flume or trough.

## Fall

In the fall, the harvested rice is stacked and then threshed—by flailing, treading, or grinding in a mortar—to loosen the hulls. The rice grains are separated from their husks, called chaff, by tossing them above a sheet or mat.
