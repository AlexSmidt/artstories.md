![Charles, Vasa, Minnesota](http://api.artsmia.org/images/105014/large.jpg)

He looks like a Charles.  He has that Charles sophistication, wearing college-professor glasses and sporting a full brown beard.  He is tall, fit, and even noble.  His professorship, though, ends there.  No tweed coat or thick corduroys.  No leather-bound books or church spires in the background.

Charles seems more like a Charlie.  He is happy and playful, even while standing in an utterly bleak environment of construction materials, snow, and a barren landscape.  It looks like Minnesota, just damn cold. He wears a winter hat and an aviator jumpsuit, and holds two toy airplanes.  He shows viewers his toys with childlike joy.

Whether Charles or Charlie, this Vasa, Minnesota resident is truly appealing and likeable.  He is welcoming.  He is the everyman.  He is alone.  But that is absolutely okay.

## Art World Star

Alec Soth once worked at the MIA photographing the collection and developing photographs in a dark room for research and promotions.  Now we are happy to have one of his photographs, *Charles, Vasa, Minnesota*.  Charles helped make the thirty-five-year-old Soth famous at the 2004 Whitney Biennial, an exhibition known for launching artists’ careers. The Whitney Museum of American Art featured Charles in their advertising materials and on its website, and a The *New York Times* critic reviewing the exhibition singled out Soth as a “discovery.”  The rest is history.  

## Where’s the Mississippi?

Charles appears in Soth’s celebrated book, *Sleeping by the Mississippi*, which contains what one writer called “forty-six ruthlessly edited pictures.”  Soth travelled along America’s longest river, but few photographs actually show the Mississippi.  Instead, he shows river life through landscapes and its people.

## Who Is Charles?

Charles stands holding two toy airplanes.  Both name and planes, painted with red, white, and blue stars and stripes, links this Charles with Charles Lindbergh, the American aviator.  Soth also photographs Lindbergh’s childhood bed in his series.

## Road Trip

Alec Soth follows a long line of artists and writers who took to the American roads to discover the country’s identity through art.  Other artists who gleaned American culture for their art include photographer Walker Evans’ American Photographs (1938), writer Jack Kerouac’s novel *On the Road* (1951), and Robert Frank’s *The Americans* (1958).
