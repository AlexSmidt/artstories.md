He looks like a Charles. He has the sophistication, wearing college-professor glasses and sporting a full brown beard. He is tall, fit, even noble. His professorship, though, ends there. No tweed coat or thick corduroys. No leather-bound books or chapel spires in the background. Charles seems more like a Charlie. He is happy and playful, even in this bleak environment, displaying his toy airplanes with innocent joy. Whether Charles or Charlie, this Minnesota man is truly appealing and likeable. He is also alone. But that is absolutely okay.

## Art World Star

Alec Soth once labored in the MIA’s darkroom. Now the museum owns his artwork. This photo was displayed at the 2004 Whitney Biennial and in the advertising for the show. A *New York Times* reviewer singled out Soth as a “discovery.” The rest is history.

## Where’s the Mississippi?

Charles appears in Soth’s celebrated book, *Sleeping by the Mississippi*, which contains what one writer called “46 ruthlessly edited pictures.” Soth travelled along America’s longest river, but few photographs actually show the Mississippi. Instead, he shows river life through the people and places alongside it.

## Road Trip

Alec Soth follows a long line of artists and writers who took to the American roads to discover the country’s identity through art, including Walker Evans’ *American Photographs* (1938), Jack Kerouac’s novel *On the Road* (1951), and Swiss-born photographer Robert Frank’s *The Americans* (1958).

## Who Is Charles?

Charles is linked by name and by the red, white, and blue markings of his model airplanes to the all-American aviator Charles Lindbergh. Soth also photographed Lindbergh’s childhood bed in this series.
