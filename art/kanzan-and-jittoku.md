Who are these two Chinese figures, one hunched over a rock, preparing ink while his friend enscribes a poem on the wall of a cave? They are Kanzan (known an Hanshan in Chinese) and Jittoku (known as Shide in Chinese). They were poets, monks, hermits, and misfits during China’s Tang Dynasty (618–907), and were celebrated for their religiosity and poetry first in China and later among Zen Buddhists in Japan.

## Kanzan and Jittoku

They are more than famous poets and enlightened monks. Kanzan and Jittoku were believed to be reincarnations of Monju (Manjusri in Sanskrit) and Fugen (Samantabhadra in Sanskrit), respectively, bodhisattvas (beings intent on achieving enlightenment) of wisdom and benevolence. 

## Jittoku

Jittoku rubs an ink-stick onto the top of a wettened rock to prepare ink for his friend Kanzan. 

## Kanzan

Kanzan uses the ink prepared for him by Jittoku to brush a poem on the wall of a cave, although the marks he makes are not legible. 

## Folding fan

This painting was once the face of a folding fan- heavy vertical creases made by the fan's wooden ribs can still be seen. It was later mounted as a hanging scroll.
