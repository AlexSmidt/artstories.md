Most people don’t ride deer. Not in Japan, anyway—with one exception. According to Shinto belief, the first deity honored at Kasuga Shrine flew there on the back of a white deer, a transportation option reserved for gods. The shrine was built in 768 by the powerful Fujiwara family on the plains below Mount Mikasa, near Nara. The mountain appears here in the distance, while clouds suggesting the divine deer’s heavenly origin swirl around its feet and a golden disc rests atop it within a sacred tree. This painting is a mandala, a symbol of the universe derived from Hindu and Buddhist traditions.

## Divine Protection

The five main Shinto deities enshrined at Kasuga are pictured on a golden disk. They are arranged in a traditional Buddhist format- five in a circle- showing how much the two religious traditions became intertwined after the arrival of Buddhism to Japan in the 500s, around 250 years before the Kasuga Shrine was built. 

## Messenger of the Spirits

Deer are regarded as messengers of the divine spirit (*kami*) that inhabits the nearby sacred hills, and freely roam the grounds of the Kasuga Shrine to this day. 

## Divinity in Nature

Mount Mikasa was revered as the home of deities long before any permanent shrine was constructed. 

## A Human Face

Shinto gods were never depicted in human form until Buddhism arrived in Japan in the 500s. 

## Earthly Power

Clusters of wisteria blossoms, a symbol of the powerful Fujiwara family that established the Kasuga Shrine, dangle from a shoot of japonica (*sakaki*, or "sacred tree," in Japanese) on the deer's back.
