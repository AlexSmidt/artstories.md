What does paradise look like? Take a close look at this hanging scroll, illustrated with images of paradise that inspired hours of meditation for followers of Amida Buddha, the central figure of Pure Land Buddhism. This *Contemplation or Visualization Sutra*, one of the faith’s three main scriptures, describes paradise in rich detail, from Amida Buddha himself to the ponds, gardens, and jeweled palaces. And it provides clear instructions for getting there in the next life: visualize every detail of the place in meditation. Pure Land Buddhism attracted many followers in Japan and other parts of Asia with its message that paradise is within anyone’s reach.

## A Revelation

Side panels illustrate the sutra, or scripture, verse by verse. On the left side we see the revelation of the sutra's message to an Indian queen. 

## Contemplations

Side panels illustrate the sutra, or scripture, verse by verse. The right side shows the 13 contemplations required to reach the Pure Land. 

## Rebirth

The bottom panel depicts the nine levels of rebirth described in the sutra, or scripture. Buddhists believe that people are reborn after death, as either a higher or lower form of being based on their actions in their previous life, a concept known as karma. 

## Welcome to My Paradise

Amida Buddha, one of the five wisdom buddhas, presides over his paradise from a lotus seat, flanked by two bodhisattvas (enlightened beings who postpone becoming buddhas themselves to help others reach enlightenment). 

## A Final Rebirth

Followers of Amida Buddhism can escape the cycle of death and rebirth, and find their way to the Pure Land paradise, by regularly visualizing what that paradise looks like– as well as living a good clean life. Here, two newly born residents meet with Amida Buddha. 

## Jeweled Pavilions

This mandala depicts the jeweled pavilions and splendid gardens of the Pure Land paradise as described in the *Contemplation Sutra*, or scripture. 

## Crowded Skies

The *Contemplation Sutra* describes flying beings filling the Pure Land sky, along with Buddhas and bodhisattvas visiting from other Buddha-lands. 

## A Japanese Cinderella Story

Chūjōhime, an eighth-century noblewoman, fled to a temple to escape her wicked stepmother. Legend has it that Amida Buddha visited her there and wove a splendid tapestry of the Pure Land. Many copies were made, including this one.
