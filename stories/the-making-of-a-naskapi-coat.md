How long does it take to make a coat like this? The Innu artist would stretch, clean, dry, scrape, soften, and work the hide. Then she would repeat this process, once maybe twice.

After the hide is meticulously tailored and sewn to perfection, a carved antler is used to create the designs with mineral and plant pigments.

Hereâ€™s how the designs came together: The hunter had a sacred dream in which he envisioned the design for his coat. He would share this with his wife, who would incorporate the dream design into the coat. All other design elements were the artistic prerogative of the wife. Worn during hunting, the shirt would please the lord of the caribou, prompting him to release more for the men to hunt.
