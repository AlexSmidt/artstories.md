William Kentridge uses music to help get the messages across in his animations and gallery installations. Composer Phillip Miller talks about working with Kentridge and adding the right sound to complement the animations. Of working with the already finished film, he says, “It was probably the first and last time I worked quite like that…  I think that when he starts to film he has a kind of rhythm and he can take that idea and play with it with me.”

In another project, Kentridge began with the music then started creating animations. For the Metropolitan Opera’s 2013 production of *The Nose*, a satirical Russian opera written in 1928, Kentridge created animation, charcoal drawings, puppets, newspaper clippings, and even a large papier-mâché nose.
