Chuck Close explains why he focused on painting portraits throughout his artistic career. He describes periods in his life when painting underwent widespread rejection by artists and critics. Rather than be deterred by this prevailing sentiment, Close used the disinterest in painting to his advantage; he both adopted and pushed the traditions of portraiture to make his own unique style.

Chuck Close describes how he broke down his large paintings into bite size pieces using a grid pattern. Each square on the canvas contains a range of colors and shapes that together construct a portrait. He never painted further than an arm’s length away and focused on one square at a time. Close relates his process of painting to a composer writing a score of music. Because of years of experience, the composer can predict what the music will sound like even before the musicians play it. Similarly, while Close only painted one small square at a time, he could envision what his painting would look like before it was completed.
