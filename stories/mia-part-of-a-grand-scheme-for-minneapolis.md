The Civic Commission of Minneapolis commissioned a Master Plan, published in 1917, that would guide a modern, well-ordered metropolis that would be a “city useful” as well as a “city beautiful.” The result was a grand scheme with huge boulevards and massive buildings, like Paris on the prairie—not very human-scaled.

Declaring that the museum as constructed “is not in touch with the ebb and flow of the daily life of the city,” a Sixth Avenue diagonal extension was proposed to connect downtown Minneapolis to Mia—where a formal garden would be constructed in Fair Oaks Park—and continue southwest to the shore of Lake Harriet.

World War II and other factors led to very little of the plan being realized, just the Gateway Park and Arcade, a trapezoidal section to the upper right in this rendering, with a tree-lined approach and pool.
