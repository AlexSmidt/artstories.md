Hokusai was reportedly rather eccentric and constantly in debt—he apparently changed houses 90 times. He was born in Edo and initially trained as a carver of woodblocks. At 18, he entered the studio of the established print designer Katsukawa Shunshō (1726–93).

Hokusai moved on to study under other artists and, for various reasons, frequently changed his artistic name. His art teachers gave him some of the names, others he adopted as his artistic style changed. Hokusai’s earliest work was an actor print dating from 1778; his last dates to around 1839, meaning he was actively printing for at least 60 years.

His most celebrated works are *Hokusai manga*, a series of sketch books, and his pictures of Mt. Fuji, as captured in the series *Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji*.
