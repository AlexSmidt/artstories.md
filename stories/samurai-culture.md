Samurai are now synonymous with Japan, but in the long history of Japanese culture they are a relatively recent invention. In the 1100s, wealthy landowners began hiring warriors to protect their property—private armies for powerful clans. This screen illustrates a battle between the two most powerful armies, the Minamoto and Taira, who challenged the central government and battled each other for control of Japan.  Minamoto won, and his samurai-led government ruled Japan for the next 700 years.

Samurai became the military nobility of Japan, their chief duty to protect and honor their master. One samurai wrote, “When one is serving officially or in the master's court, he should not think of a hundred or a thousand people, but should consider only the importance of the master.”  To have a selfless, at times senseless, devotion to their master brought honor to the warriors and their descendants.

Like European knights and their code of chivalry, Samurai warriors adhered to a strict code of ethics known as *bushidō*, or “the way of the warrior.” *Bushidō* formalized the samurai code and emphasized seven main tenets: goodness, courage, compassion, respect, honesty, honor, and loyalty.

To follow the *bushidō* code was to prepare for death—the ultimate honor and purpose of the samurai life. They were willing to sacrifice everything—even their lives—to their duty and could not go into battle with fear. St. Francis Xaviar, a missionary in Japan, observed that “The Japanese are much braver and more warlike than the people of China, Korea, Ternate, and all of the other nations around the Philippines. … There is no nation in the world which fears death less.”

Samurai warriors are most commonly associated with the Japanese sword known as a *katana*, a long, single-edged, curved blade mounted on a hilt meant for two hands and said to exact a deadly blow in one swipe. *Katana* were an important cultural symbol for samurai—present at the birth of a son or in the arms of a samurai being buried. A *katana* worn with a smaller companion sword became the samaurai’s trademark combination, known as *daishō*—literally “big/little.”

Samurai teachings remain embedded in modern Japanese life. Karate, Judo, and Aikido stem from the original samurai combat tradition, and such fighting figures prominently in film, TV, and video games today.  One of the best-known samurai films is *The Seven Samurai*, which was later reworked into the *The Magnificent Seven*, a popular Western.
