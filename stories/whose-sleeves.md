"Whose sleeves?” is an odd question with an elegant answer. The phrase, *tagasode* in Japanese, comes from a poem written in the 900s that observes how a person’s fragrance and belongings can more powerfully suggest their physical presence than a conventional likeness. \
    \
        *The fragrance seems even more alluring than the hue,\
        Whose sleeves have brushed past?\
        Or would it be this plum tree blossoming here at home?*

Tagasode screens depicting clothes hanging on racks in an empty room were immensely popular in the early 1600s. They may be based on an ancient practice of draping garments over clothing racks to use as interior partitions. Besides the practical function, it was an opportunity to show off treasured possessions.

Women of the pleasure quarters, and their luxurious garments, were a staple of Japanese paintings. *Tagasode *screens took this interest in costume one step further, leaving out the women altogether. Interest in the genre declined after 1650 as the rising merchant class proved less interested in the genre's suble poetic message.
