In the early 20th century, museum staff used X-rays to peer inside Tashat’s mummy case, or *cartonnage*, and discovered that she was not alone: a second skull sat between her legs. Then, in 1983, Tashat became only the second mummy in the United States to undergo a CT scan, revealing something that made headlines in tabloids as well as scholarly journals.

Tashat’s mummy, far from the serene depiction on her coffin, was twisted and battered, her ribs broken, her arm shattered, her spine removed, and her feet slashed. She had been decapitated and the skull between her legs was smashed. What could possibly have happened to this teenage girl?

Speculation abounded, largely positing that Tashat was entangled in a forbidden romance. Once discovered, the theory went, the couple was tortured and killed, embalmed and entombed together for eternity. Good fodder for a torrid mummy mystery, which is exactly what Carol Thurston thought—her novel *Eye of Horus* (2001) kept the lurid details while moving the museum to Denver. But what really happened is no less intriguing.

Tashat was born into an Egypt in decline—the old ways were lapsing, evidenced by the sloppy hieroglyphic penmanship adorning her coffin. This led scholars to speculate that slipshod embalmers had treated Tashat like, well, a bag of bones, shattering her body during mummification. With a little slapstick imagination, this even explained the second skull: finding an unclaimed head in their workshop, the story went, the embalmers tucked it into the mummy at hand.

The consensus today is even more conniving: grave robbers. To relieve Tashat of her jewels and amulets would have meant unwrapping her. And that would have been hard to do without wrecking her. When the ransacking was discovered, Tashat must have been rewrapped. But before she was returned to her coffin, the extra skull—likely belonging to a relative whose body was beyond repair—was included, sealing two family members for eternity.
