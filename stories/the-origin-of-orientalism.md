Orientalism, or Western artists’ obsession with the exotic East, began with Napoleon’s conquest of Egypt in the 1800s and was buoyed by French colonization of North Africa. Delacroix’s orientalism was inspired initially by literature, primarily Lord Byron’s poetry, then by his own travels in North Africa. Later, he returned to imagined imagery, commenting in his unpublished memoirs on his Moroccan experience, “I now see only through a cloud a cluster of circumstances that had fixed my attention. Many of these appear to me as so many dreams.”

Delacroix was one of the first French artists to visit North Africa after the French invasion of Algiers, in 1830. His initial paintings in response to that experience had an air of authenticity often lacking in later orientalists’ works. By the 1850s, his orientalist subjects served largely as pretexts for testing his aesthetic theories, prompting younger artists like Renoir to retrace his footsteps in North Africa in hopes of understanding his techniques.

Delacroix’s orientalism rarely lapsed into erotic fantasies, later popularized in the “harem” genre. Nor did he view the Arabs and Jews of North Africa as primitives to be civilized or savages to be suppressed; rather, he envisioned there a “living antiquity,” with the inhabitants like “Roman senators or Greeks at the Parthenaien festival,” robed in simple attire that nevertheless projected “nobility.” When he entered the household of the Women of Algiers, for instance, he exclaimed “It is beautiful! Like the age of \[ancient Greek poet\] Homer.”

During his visit to Morocco in 1832, Delacroix wrote extensively about the Moorish cemeteries that dotted the roadside outside Tangier’s city walls, one providing the setting for this painting. The woman wears the habit of a Moroccan Jew, but her state of casual undress is inconsistent with the fact that custom required she wrap herself in a veiled shroud when in public. She also towers over her male observers, and her frontal pose and enigmatic gaze project an image of classical calm and beauty, which Delacroix perpetually exalted in ancient sculpture and Moroccan women.

The statuesque woman in this painting has the appearance and stance of the sculpted woman—which an inscription identifies as Plathane—in this funerary stele, or tombstone, from ancient Athens.
