The title of this installation, 6EQUJ5, comes from a 72-second segment of radio signal data collected by the Big Ear radio telescope at Ohio State University in 1977, part of the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) project. The telescope gathered 22 years of data on celestial narrowband radio signals, starting in 1973.

The strength of celestial narrowband signals at brief intervals was recorded with a single-digit code, starting with 1-9 and followed by the letters of the alphabet. “A,” for example, was equivalent to 10, “B” to 11, etc. “Q” represents an intensity of 26.

Narrowband signals (like radio and TV, radar, and satellite transmissions) do not occur naturally in space and are thought to indicate a signal from an intelligent being. The intensity of signal represented by the pattern “6EQUJ5” matched theoretical predictions for what purposeful interstellar communication from life outside our galaxy might look like. Nothing like it has ever been observed again.
