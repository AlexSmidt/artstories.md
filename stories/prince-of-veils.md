Monti may have perfected the veiled figure, but he was hardly the first to try it. Antonio Corradini began the trend in the early 18th century, and soon sculptors were putting all manner of subjects under marble veils, from Christ to Mary Magdalene. This is Corradini’s *Modesty* (1750) from the Museo Cappella Sansevero in Naples, Italy.

Veils were just one of the sculptural high-wire acts of the late Baroque period. Sculptors also put figures under “see-through” garments and even a net, as Francesco Queirolo did for <span>*Disillusion*, (1753-54),</span> at the Museo Cappella Sansevero in Naples, Italy, a work once described as “the last and most trying test to which sculpture in marble can aspire.”
