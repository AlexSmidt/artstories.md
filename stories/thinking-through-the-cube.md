Sol LeWitt was fascinated by cubes from the earliest days of his career, not because of what they expressed but what they didn’t. He liked the shape for its neutrality, as he explained in 1966: “Compared to any other three-dimensional form, the cube lacks any aggressive force, implies no motion, and is least emotive.”

LeWitt wanted to see if he could remove his own imagination from the artistic process. He was inspired in part by the stop-motion photography of Eadweard Muybridge to create similar series of variations driven by an external, objective idea—often a mathematical or geometric progression. As he famously said, “The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.”

LeWitt produced incomplete cube variations in at least five different formats. The process of working through the idea was the point. As he explained in 1967, “All the intervening steps, scribbles, sketches, drawings, failed work models, studies, thoughts, conversations are of interest. Those that show the thought process of the artist are sometimes more interesting than the final product.”
