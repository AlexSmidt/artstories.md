Millet made *The Church at Chailly* for Émile Gavet, a Parisian collector-dealer who struck an enterprising deal with the artist in 1865. Millet received a monthly income and supplies in exchange for pastels of subjects dictated by Gavet. In five years, Millet produced 95 of them.

A letter to Gavet indicates that Millet was at work on *The Church at Chailly* in December 1868. The artist wrote of recent difficulties—his young daughter's illness from scarlet fever and his own disfiguring skin infection—but concluded optimistically, “I am getting better and working on my view of Chailly.”

Just months after Millet's death in 1875, Gavet organized an exhibition of the artist’s pastels in Paris. That show, and the sale of Gavet’s collection the following June, brought the works international acclaim.
