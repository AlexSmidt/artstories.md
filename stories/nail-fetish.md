*Feitiço*. This medieval Portuguese word, originally meaning “charm,” gave Europeans a name for a class of African sculptures and also provided a term used to label the spirituality and religion of non-western peoples around the world. Ever since they first encountered it in the 1500s, Europeans considered the so-called “nail fetish” as the prime example of such object and mindset. They mistook the *nkisi* figures as an instance of irrational beliefs in the power of magic. Today, we know that they reflect a complex moral, social, and cosmological worldview.

And in an ironic twist of history, it is now Western collectors and curators who “fetishize” African objects, attaching great monetary value to them and revering them in their museums.

This community power figure, standing three feet tall, protected an entire village against evil influences from within and without. Its raised right hand used to hold a spear. The numerous nails, iron plates, and cutting blades testify to its long history of settling disputes and sealing agreements.
