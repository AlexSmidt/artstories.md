<p><em>Feitiço</em>. This medieval Portuguese word, originally meaning “charm,” gave Europeans a name for a class of African sculptures and also provided a term used to label the spirituality and religion of non-western peoples around the world. Ever since they first encountered it in the 1500s, Europeans considered the so-called “nail fetish” as the prime example of such object and mindset. They mistook the <em>nkisi</em> figures as an instance of irrational beliefs in the power of magic. Today, we know that they reflect a complex moral, social, and cosmological worldview.</p><p>And in an ironic twist of history, it is now Western collectors and curators who “fetishize” African objects, attaching great monetary value to them and revering them in their museums.</p><p>This community power figure, standing three feet tall, protected an entire village against evil influences from within and without. Its raised right hand used to hold a spear. The numerous nails, iron plates, and cutting blades testify to its long history of settling disputes and sealing agreements.</p>
