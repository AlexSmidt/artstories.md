War photography appeared shortly after the medium was invented, in 1839, with lenses aimed at soldiers planning, fighting, and perishing in warfare and civilians caught in the crossfire. Working for *LIFE* magazine, Margaret Bourke-White photographed concentration camp survivors at the end of World War II.

Photography of the Crimean War—fought in the 1850s by Russia against an alliance of Britain, France, and the Ottoman Empire—forever changed the public’s feelings about the glories of the battlefield. British photographers like Roger Fenton appalled viewers with the reality of dead bodies and spent cannon balls in the aftermath of battle, more real than the sketches the public was used to seeing.

The American Civil War was well-documented by photographers Alexander Gardner and Matthew Brady. They had to make their own film on the battlefield and expose the glass negatives to light while they were still wet with chemicals. Their cumbersome cameras wouldn’t capture action, so they focused instead on soldiers planning missions or the gruesome results—occasionally rearranging bodies for dramatic effect.

By the 1930s, cameras were very portable—no larger than they are today—and capable of capturing action. This advance allowed photographers to document a battle in progress and reveal the human face of war.

Digital cameras and smartphones today are extremely portable and capture battles in color and with great detail. Wielded by soldiers and civilians, they offer additional perspectives to those of professional photographers.
