St. Anthony is the patron saint of lost stuff, one reason he’s popular with Catholics—thousands pray to him every day to help recover their belongings. But he’s probably more interested in lost souls.

The Franciscan friar from Lisbon, Portugal, died in 1231 and was adopted by the people of Kongo after  Portugal made contact with the African kingdom in 1483, sparking a cultural exchange that led to the Kongo people’s conversion to Catholicism and eventual ensnarement in the slave trade. Kongo Catholics portrayed St. Anthony in art much as Europeans did, in a Franciscan friar’s habit and hood along with the Bible and Christ child, who had appeared to him in a vision.

St. Anthony was known in his day as the “Hammer of Heretics” for his clear teaching that left no room for misinterpretation, or heretical viewpoints. Yet in a darkly ironic twist, Beatriz Kimpa Vita, who had championed St. Anthony in the Kongo and placed him at the center of her people’s faith, was burned as a heretic.
