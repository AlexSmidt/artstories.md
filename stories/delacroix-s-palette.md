Compare the energy of *Convulsionists of Tangier* to the works of Delacroix’s contemporaries and you’ll understand why he’s considered one of the great colorists of the 19th century. Corot’s *Silenus*, in this same gallery, was displayed in the Salon of 1838 along with *Convulsionists*. Delacroix’s innovative color theories, as seen in the widely diverging palettes, make all the difference.

The stark bright light of North African cities and the vibrant colors of the local clothing affirmed Delacroix’s dynamic and unprecedented use of color. The small orange at the front of the scene, for instance, below the man biting his own arm, contrasts with the blues of the celebrant’s sleeves and references Morocco’s bounty. A rare treat in Delacroix’s native France, the fruit in this context looks even more delectable and exotic.

In 1881, the Neo-Impressionist artist Georges Seurat studied three paintings from the collection of Alfred Edwards before their sale at auction, including the *The Convulsionists of Tangier*. Fascinated by Delacroix’s innovative color theory, he wrote extensively on the colors used throughout the composition.
