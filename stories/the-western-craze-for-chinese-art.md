“Made in China” became a coveted distinction starting in the 1600s, when the Dutch and English East India companies began a brisk business shipping spices, tea, silk, porcelain, and other luxury goods to Europe. This Chinese export coffee pot shows Dutch Ships in Cape Town, South Africa, a popular stop en route. (On view, G209)

Chinese porcelain fascinated Westerners, who coveted this pure white, glasslike ceramic developed by the Chinese during the Tang Dynasty (from the 800s to the 1100s). European ceramic firms did not have a recipe to make it for themselves until the early 1700s.

The Chinese were shipping so much porcelain to Europe and the American colonies by the 1700s that they used the heavy loads as ballast--goods providing stability. Europeans commissioned decoration in a variety of styles, sending examples to Chinese factories to work from, never mind the cultural mash-ups that often followed.

“Chinoiserie” generally means “in the Chinese taste,” and there was plenty of it in colonial America and Europe. The 1762 edition of Thomas Chippendale’s famous pattern book The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker’s Director (London) added “Chinese” furniture—adorned with fretwork or pagodas—that English or American craftsmen could make for clients.
