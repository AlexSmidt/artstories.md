Here in the West, every Japanese robe is usually called a kimono, which simply means “thing to wear.” This particular thing is a kosode, made from 12 to 15 yards of narrow fabric and requiring few cuts, resulting in little waste compared to a business suit, which uses nearly the same amount of fabric but wastes up to 40 percent of it. The panels are assembled to place the design at the appropriate parts of the garment, taken apart to be dyed, and then reassembled.

The kosode would have been woven, embellished, and possibly hand-painted. Other ways of treating fabrics for different effects, as shown here, include *Shibori *which is similar to tie-dyeing, producing varied patterns depending on how the cloth is folded. Surface patterns are added to a bolt of cloth using a variety of elaborate techniques.

*Katasome *is a method using a resistant rice paste and applied through a paper stencil. After dyeing, the paste is washed away and the pattern remains.

Strict regulations controlled the material and design of kimono during the Edo period. Clothing and hairstyles could identify a person by class and occupation. Here, from left to right, are ladies of the warrior class and wives of merchants...
