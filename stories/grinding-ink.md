Calligraphy and painting have long been celebrated arts in Japan. A painter or calligrapher would make his own ink using an inkstone in order to precisely control its shade and thickness. After putting some water in the deeper end, the well, he would slowly rub the inkstick through the water and over the slightly rough surface of the inkstone.Â
