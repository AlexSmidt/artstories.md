Matisse believed drawing to be essential to the proper training of a young painter. For his own work, he always found it helpful in coordinating his mind, eye, and hand. Matisse compared his preparatory work in drawing to that done each morning by “a dancer or acrobat…with several hours of limbering-up exercises.”

Matisse drew in order to discover the essence of a subject. Because of its simplicity, Matisse judged pure line drawing the most direct method by which to communicate his emotions about a motif. Through the simple act of applying pencil to paper, Matisse’s lines convey a tremendous amount of power and meaning.

Matisse’s prints reveal his great creative imagination, his working methods, his mental commitment, and emotional input in pursuit of his objective. Matisse primarily turned to printmaking after long and difficult painting sessions in order to create variations on a theme that currently interested him. He would also delve deeply into a specific technique, exploring and pushing that medium’s boundaries and possibilities, only to then abandon the technique for years at a time.

These forays into a different medium were both practical and innovative. They reflect the evolution of his ideas as they relate to the development of poses, the study of facial expressions and human anatomy, or the transformation of a subject from representational to abstracted form.

In 1930, relatively late in his career, Matisse began work as an illustrator of fine books. He designed some of the most beautiful modern editions of the writings of distinguished French poets of the Renaissance and the nineteenth century.  For his principal projects, Matisse approached illustration as the beautification and enrichment of a text with images that corresponded in feeling to the author’s. He distinguished his process from the more orthodox and less imaginative method of literal, imitative illustration. Matisse often executed a number of studies and variants of a given image. Finally, following a close re-reading of the text, he would select from among his variations the image that he believed most closely matched the true tenor of the book.

Sculpture functioned as a complementary study to Matisse’s painting, and frequently coincided with moments of crisis and change in his artistic style and subject: much like print making and drawing, it offered Matisse a way to work through artistic problems. When his interests shifted to the human form, for example, sculpture allowed him a more intimate knowledge of the figure because the added dimension enabled him to experience mass and volume more completely.

Matisse most often modeled small, freestanding female nudes in clay. The small format gave him direct control over the essentials of form, which was his main interest: the projection of the body, the intertwining of limbs, and the interaction between solid form and surrounding void.
