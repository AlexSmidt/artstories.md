The term Rococo probably derives from the French *rocaille* (decorative stonework of grottos, fountains, and shells) and *coquillage* (a shell)—popular imagery among French tastemakers of the early 1700s. Taking their cue from natural forms, *Rococo* designers splashed curving, asymmetrical shapes onto everything from wall decorations and mirrors to serving dishes and knick-knacks.

The tastemakers of the time were shaking off the weighty grandeur that had been all the rage under Louis XIV, the “Sun King.” (Think of the Palace of Versailles, with its strict symmetry and majesty.)

The bloom came off the Rococo rose in the 1760s, when critics condemned the style as tasteless, frivolous, and symbolic of a corrupt society. The pendulum of style swung again toward the stoic order and noble aims of neoclassicism.
