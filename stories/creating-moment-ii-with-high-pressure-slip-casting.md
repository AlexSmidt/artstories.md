1-2. Joins three sections of plaster mold.

3\. Attaches the molds using a wooden frame and bolts so that the mold will withstand pressure. A rubber board is placed as cushioning between the wooden frame and the mold.

4\. Porcelain slip is mixed.

5\. The slip is filtered through a sieve approximately 100 times.

6\. The filtered slip is placed in a pressurized tank.

7\. The tank is completely sealed.

8-9. The hose from the pressurized tank is connected to the valve of the plaster mold.

10\. Pressure inside the mold is slowly increased to 0.85 kpa (0.123 psi) using air from the compressor and is maintained for a total of three hours. During this time, the liquid porcelain will condense to approximately 13 millimeters (0.5 inch).

11\. A 5-millimeter (0.2 inch) straw is placed into the plaster mold.

12\. Air is slowly pumped into the mold through the straw with an automatic bicycle tire pump.

13\. Pressure from the compressor pushes excess slip out through the hose.

14, After the excess slip is removed, the clay is dried for three hours and then the wooden frame is removed.

15\. The process of removing the plaster mold.

16\. After removing two sections of the mold, the last section is propped up with a wooden board.

17-18. The mold is elevated so that the wooden board becomes its base.

19\. The last section is slowly separated from the work.

20\. The slip-cast work right after the last section of mold has been removed.

21\. The work is left to dry completely.

22\. The artist checks the progress of drying.

23\. The artist corrects slight distortions that occur during drying using various tools, for example, metal tools such as a Tungaloy knife, and sandpaper.

24-25. The artist scrapes, shaves, and sharpens the form with the knife shown in step 23.

26\. Sandpaper is used to polish the work and complete the finishing touches to the form.

27\. Dust and impurities are removed from the surface with a wet brush.

28-29. After bisque firing in an electric kiln at 850°C (1562°F), the artist’s *seihakuji* glaze is sprayed onto the surface with a spray gun.

30\. The process of reduction firing. The firing lasts 30 hours. Firing temperature is set at 1250°C (2282°F), while the reduction temperatures of 860°-1180°C (1580-2159°F) are achieved through liquefied petroleum gas firing.

31\. The fired work inside the kiln.

32\. The unglazed parts of the works are polished or removed with a polishing machine. A wooden base designed by the artist is attached, and the work is now completed.
