A mandala packs the entire cosmos into a simple shape—and by studying it, you can unpack its secrets. Often a geometric diagram, this “map” of the abstract or theoretical universe is used in rituals or meditation to help people understand their place in relation to the deities of the Hindu or Buddhist universe. “Mandala” comes from a Sanskrit word for “circle,” as Buddhist traditions grew out of Hindu practices.

Tibetan sand mandalas are usually swept away after they’re created—it’s the creation itself, the mental exercise of visualizing the sacred Buddhist universe, that’s important. Monks used special sand in making this mandala, to preserve it for display at the museum.

The directions for creating a mandala like this, called a Sonshō mandala, were derived from an ancient Sanskrit text. They’re part of an esoteric Buddhist ritual designed to bring prosperity and well-being, and are very particular about which gods go where in the composition. For instance, “In the left foreground corner, paint inside a half-moon Gòsanze with raised foot, and in the right foreground corner, in a red shining triangle, \[paint\] Fudò in a half-lotus position on top of a rocky crag.”

The Taima mandala is crammed with details of the paradise known as Amida's Pure Land, helping the faithful visualize the place– a requirement for rebirth there in the next life.

The Shinto practices that are native to Japan absorbed many influences from Buddhism, including the use of mandalas. But in Shinto tradition, mandalas are not a tool for meditation. Instead, they offer priests a way to engage the Shinto deities.
