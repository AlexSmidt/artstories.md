*The Twin Cities has long been home to diverse communities of the African diaspora. It hosts the largest Somali population outside of Africa as well as significant numbers of people originally from Ethiopia, Liberia, and other African countries. This video series showcases representatives from multiple African communities in Minnesota. Each individual shares a specific point of view on his or her homeland and on their life in Minnesota.*
