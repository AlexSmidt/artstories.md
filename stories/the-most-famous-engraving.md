Dürer's breathtaking skill as an engraver has never been equaled. His ability to render form, detail, and lighting effects is simply mesmerizing. In *Melencolia I*, he presents us with a tantalizing array of objects that catch our eyes with their exact rendering and then seize our imagination with their symbolic possibilities. This dense image remains compelling after 500 years and slowly continues to give up its secrets.

As with most engravings, *Melencolia I* exists in many examples. The Minneapolis Institute of Arts has had one in its collection since 1913. A few years ago, our curators grew dissatisfied with that specimen, which proved to have been printed several years after Dürer had engraved the copper plate. At some point long ago, it had also been touched up with dabs of white paint in an attempt to brighten its drab appearance. Recently, the outstandingly fine example became available; so, the MIA replaced the one it had had for ninety-nine years with one that more fully reflects Dürer's brilliant achievement.
