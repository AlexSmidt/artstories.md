Dürer’s breathtaking skill as an engraver has never been equaled. His ability to render form, detail, and lighting effects is simply mesmerizing. In *Melencolia I*, he presents a tantalizing array of objects that catch our eyes with their exact rendering then seize our imagination with their symbolic possibilities. This dense image remains compelling after 500 years, and slowly continues to give up its secrets.

As with most engravings, there are multiple versions of *Melencolia I*. The MIA has had one in its collection since 1913, a rather drab example that at some point was touched up with white paint to brighten its appearance. Recently, the fine example presented here became available, so the MIA replaced its lesser example with a better reflection of Dürer’s brilliant achievement.
