Goya had been seriously ill once before, when he was 46, and afterwards was completely deaf for the rest of his life. While recovering, he read the philosophers of the Enlightenment, who argued that human affairs should be governed by reason and science, not tradition or superstition, inspiring modern ideas about democracy and equality and the revolutions in France and America.

By the time he was an old man, Goya had lost hope for the ideas of the Enlightenment. The French revolutionaries had turned brutal. The new king of Spain proved even crueler than his predecessors. The world seemed a terrible place to Goya, who began painting horrifying figures on the walls of his new house. (These murals, known as the “Black Paintings,” were later cut from the walls and taken to the Museo del Prado in Madrid.) His illness must have seemed yet another calamity.

Enter Dr. Arrieta, whose devoted care brought Goya back to health. At the time, the Spanish King Ferdinand was forced to accept a constitution. And while this picture may be seen as a simple thank-you to Dr. Arrieta, it may also be a statement of hope—reason, in the form of modern medicine—potentially making the world a better place after all.
