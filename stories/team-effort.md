It takes a village to raise a *boli*, starting with conception. A new *boli* begins with several community leaders—members of the Kono religious association—agreeing to allocate responsibilities for its creation and care. This particular *boli* had grown rather large, to the size of a microwave oven, which means it was used as an altar by an entire village. That said, while the *boli* resides at one family’s home, it doesn’t belong to them or anyone in the village. It belongs to the ancestors.

A *boli* is built, like many living things, around bones. A fabric bundle of bone fragments and porcupine needles is nestled inside a bamboo structure, a core that will grow as layers of natural and man-made materials are added during rituals.

It could be an anteater. Or maybe a hippo. Which is to say, this *boli* is not intended to look like any specific animal. But its appearance can change as layers are added, and the Kono association leader responsible for adding the layers skillfully manipulated the materials to create an ambiguous animal form.

With the conversion of many Bamana people to Islam and the influence of Western medicine and judicial practices, there isn’t as much demand for a *boli* as there used to be—except among European and American collectors. In fact, quite a few copies were made in the 1970s and ’80s for the art market. The MIA wanted to ensure it was getting was the real deal, so it subjected the *boli* to a high-tech exam.

A radiologist and expert in CAT-scanning works of art examined the *boli *before the museum purchased it and confirmed its authenticity. How did he know? This 3D opaque model shows any particle that is denser than air, so the blue areas on the bottom of the feet represent more densely packed material, as though they’d borne a heavy weight. That would only happen with actual use, as layers of mud, blood, and other things added during rituals began to weigh it down.
