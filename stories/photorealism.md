To a Photorealist, a picture is worth a thousand words. Transferring a photographic image to canvas or paper, artists produce meticulous reproductions of the reality captured by the lens of a camera. Photorealism emerged in late 1960s America in response to other artists who favored the representation of movement and the physical properties of paint. Photorealist artists reject abstraction so they can better capture the objective reality of a photograph, literally “what we see”.

Artists working in this genre engage with a wide subject matter including urban and suburban sites, portraiture, still life, commercial imagery, or scenes from daily life. Attempting to reproduce the images captured by a camera in other artistic mediums, artists use various mechanical methods including grids, projectors, airbrushes, or transfer paper to make the closest resemblance possible.
