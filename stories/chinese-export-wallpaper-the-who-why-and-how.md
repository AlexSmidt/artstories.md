The Chinese made wallpapers they would never put in their own homes—they made them to suit European, especially English, tastes. Hard to come by at first, exports of hand-painted wallpaper peaked in 1750 as wealthy buyers were captivated with “Chinoiserie”—all things Eastern.

This isn’t like your wallpaper of roses in the bathroom, a pattern repeated ad infinitum. Chinese wallpapers were hand-painted, not printed. So nothing is repeated, anywhere on the walls. It likely took about 1,000 to 2,000 hours to make enough for one room, though the painters did use some shortcuts, like stencils for shrubs and trees. No surprise, the wallpapers cost roughly 20 times more than their European counterparts.

Chinese craftsmen catered to Western clients in sometimes surprising ways. Here, for instance, they depicted Chinese people with facial features they felt looked more Western, especially the eyes—notably different from how painters at the time depicted Chinese people for Chinese collectors. The painters may have been trained by Jesuit missionaries from Europe or copied Western prints.

Chinese wallpaper like this came to the American colonies through English importers. After the United States declared its independence in 1776, papers were imported directly from China, but the number of imports remained small. Today, there are far fewer examples of historic Chinese export wallpapers in the U.S. than in the United Kingdom and Ireland.

A similar suite of painted Chinese wallpaper adorns the parlor of Winterthur, a museum and historic house in Delaware. It was also made in the late 1700s, purchased in 1928 by the owner of Winterthur, Henry Francis Du Pont.

Unlike most wallpaper, glued on and destined to be destroyed, expensive Chinese wallpaper was hung on special wooden slats and coarse cloth, so it could be removed. Mia’s paper has a linen backing, visible in the blank area to the right of the fireplace.

Wallpaper was typically made to fit a wall—not the other way around. Chinese artisans would leave plenty of extra material for just this reason, like more sky at the top that could be cut down to fit varied ceiling heights. Even this paper was creatively cut to fit the space, with scraps pieced together to cover the chimney. Additional painting, copied from the original by local artists Tom Jance and David Marquis, filled in spots near the ceiling.
