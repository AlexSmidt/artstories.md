The *Gulshan-i ‘Ishq* (Flower Garden of Love) is part of a genre of literature called Sufi romance, which was popular when poet Mulla Nusrati wrote this story in 1657. The Sufis are often described as the “mystics” of Islam, using fasting, music, and poetry to become closer to God. The story features several lovers who must overcome obstacles before achieving happiness—a metaphor for the spiritual struggle to unite with the divine.

The garden setting reflects the Quran, the primary book of Islam, in which paradise is envisioned as a garden. The *Gulshan* describes the garden as a place of deep spirituality and harmony: “It is bright, has trees full of fruits, birds, water, and fills the heart with peace. Therefore, even [fairies] come here ‘like shooting stars’ to take their bath in its central pool.” By contrast, a neglected garden is a symbol of distress.

In 2008, UNESCO proposed a Quranic botanical garden featuring all of the plant species mentioned in the Quran, the Sunnah (Deeds of the Prophet), and the Hadith (Sayings of the Prophet). Slated for completion in 2015 in Doha, Qatar, the garden will promote environmental conservation.
