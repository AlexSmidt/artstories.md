# [Copying a Masterpiece ](http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/stories/592)

For 10 days in 2014, scholars and photographers hunkered down in the MIA to produce ultra-high-resolution images of *Rice Farming in the Four Seasons*. They were part of the Tsuzuri Project, formed In 2007 by the Kyoto Culture Association and Canon Inc. to preserve Japan’s cultural heritage. Tsurzuri teams have created 27 facsimiles of the nation’s cultural assets owned outside Japan, like this remarkable set of 400-year-old sliding doors. They left the MIA with the digital data needed to create a cloned set and install them in the temple from which the originals came.

The doors were painstakingly photographed, section by section, with Canon 5D Mark III cameras while a robot tripod head precisely pointed the 300mm lens at each of the 20 “tiles” that made up the final composite image.

Canon printers and custom-made washi paper (a type of Japanese paper made with extra-long tree bark fibers) were used to precisely match colors while the artwork was still in the photo studio.

After the crew returned to Japan, the images were printed on a wide-format printer—each screen is 36 inches wide—and the prints were enhanced by artist Hiroto Rakusho with gold paint. They were mounted by artist Hirokazu Yokoyama on antique-looking frames. 

 

The donation ceremony marking the “return” of the doors took place at the Daikakuji Temple in April 2014. Listen to Hattori Seison, Chief Abbot of Daikakuji Temple, explain the importance of restoring these panels to their original context.
