<p>African Art in Motion—the concept behind these galleries—refers to multiple modes of movement, from the kinetic uses of much African art to the transport of ideas, images, materials, and people within Africa and between continents. The arrangement of the galleries invites you to move freely, as well, walking around the art to fully experience it. The works are grouped around similarly fluid themes, united by shared uses or meanings and acknowledging the multiple purposes that many of them serve.</p>
