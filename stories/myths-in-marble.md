Bertel Thorvaldsen is known as one of the best Neoclassical, or new classical, sculptors, inspired in style and subject matter by ancient Rome and Greece.  Many of his sculptures, including *Ganymede and the Eagle*, feature prominent mythological figures as Thorvaldsen immortalizes their tales, turning myth into marble.

Thorvaldsen’s Jason with the Golden Fleece was his breakthrough sculpture while working as a student in Rome in 1803. The story of Jason and the Golden Fleece is one of the oldest and most popular Greek myths. Here, Thorvaldsen presents the hero after his journey to the edge of the known world to acquire the Golden Fleece, ready to head home and reclaim his rightful throne from his evil uncle.

Cupid—the god of desire, erotic love, and attraction—repeatedly appeared in Thorvaldsen’s sculptures. Here, in *Cupid Triumphant*, the matchmaker strikes both man and the gods powerless with one of his arrows of uncontrollable desire. Thorvaldsen communicates this by incorporating the marks of famous gods and heroes who have laid down their status symbols in submission to Cupid’s power: Hercules’s lion skin, Apollo’s lyre, Jupiter’s thunderbolt, and Mars’s helmet.

Thorvaldsen’s Venus stares lovingly at the apple in her hand. But what seems to be a healthy snack is really the cause of heavenly strife. Eris, the goddess of chaos, was excluded from a godly banquet, so she threw a golden apple among the party guests. On the side of the apple it was written “To the fairest goddess.” Because none of the gods wanted to show preference they made Paris, the mortal son of the king of Troy, choose the fairest. Thorvaldsen’s portrait is the peaceful conclusion: Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, holding the prize in her hands.

Love is tough—even without Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, rooting against you. Venus was jealous of Psyche’s beauty so she sent her son, Cupid, to make Psyche fall in love with the ugliest man in the world. Cupid accidentally pricked himself on the way and fell in love with Psyche himself.  Enraged, Venus forced Psyche to do hopeless tasks in order to marry Cupid. Here, Psyche has just completed her final task, journeying to the underworld to obtain for Venus a jar full of beauty from Persephone, the queen of the underworld. Psyche opens it, falling into an enchanted sleep. Thorvaldsen freezes Psyche in a moment between her hopeless mission and heroic love.
