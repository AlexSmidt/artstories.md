Jewelry is not merely an accessory in Indian culture. Adornments for both men and women function as amulets, warding off evil and bringing prosperity to those who touch them. The giving of jewelry is a key part of life-cycle events such as birth, naming ceremonies, puberty, and marriage.

The rudraksha necklace might have been used in a Hindu ceremony to celebrate a married man’s 60th birthday (*shastiapurti*). At the birthday celebration, the man and his wife renew their vows and reenact wedding rituals, such as draping each other in flower garlands. This ceremony marks the husband’s entry into the pious third stage of his life. Because of this important change, it is appropriate that Chettiar men would don the priestly rudrakshamala for the celebration.

Like a wedding ring in Western culture, married women of all religions in South India wear a *thali* pendant to signify their marital state. During the wedding it is passed around for the guests to bless. At the high point of the ceremony, the groom ties the necklace onto his bride. The woman only removes the *thali* from her neck if she is widowed.

Here we see a Tamil *thali*, hung on a thread dyed with turmeric, a spice often used to signify health and well-being.

Just as people adorn themselves, they adorn temples and the statues of the gods within with flowers and gold. Ornaments donated to the gods could be a gift from a devotee’s personal collection or something crafted specifically for the statue, like a crown or golden sandals.
