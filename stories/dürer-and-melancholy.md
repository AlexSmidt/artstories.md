Albrecht Dürer was the most important and accomplished Renaissance artist in Germany, his technical genius enabling his spectacular imagination and intellectual depth. He raised printmaking from a craft to high art and remains unsurpassed as an engraver. Born in 1471, he produced religious picture books, guides for artists, and even a treatise on fortification. His skill and interests in art, nature, and mathematics are clearly seen in *Melencolia I*.

Dürer's understanding of melancholy drew from the writings of Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499), a prominent Italian philosopher. Ficino saw both pluses and minuses to the condition's tendency to stimulate thought and emotion. Melancholy could drive one mad. Yet it also produced the sensitivity required for creativity. Ficino wrote, “All truly outstanding men, whether distinguished in philosophy, in statecraft, in poetry or in the arts, are melancholics.”

The fact that Dürer specified *Melencolia I*, deemed the first form of melancholy, suggests that he’d read the work of German occultist Cornelius Agrippa, who divided melancholy into three levels. Level One ruled the imagination, especially of artists. Level Two controlled scientists and physicians. Level Three governed the spirit and thought of theologians.

*Melencolia I* may be Dürer’s psychological self-portrait. The large, wide-eyed angel is saddened by its ability to envision ideal forms, knowing they are unrealizable in the physical world. Even the physical realization of Dürer’s ideal geometric solid is chipped and weathered. Meanwhile, the shut-eyed *putto*, a less ambitious artist, can freely scribble away.
