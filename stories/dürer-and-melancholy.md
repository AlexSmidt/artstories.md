Albrecht Dürer was the most important Renaissance artist in Germany. His technical genius gave expression to his spectacular imagination and intellectual depth. He raised printmaking from craft to high art and remains unsurpassed as an engraver. Born in 1471, he trained as a goldsmith, then as a painter and draughtsman. He traveled in Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy, absorbing ideas wherever he went. He produced religious picture books, guides for artists, and even a treatise on fortification. His graphic output included more than 100 engravings and several hundred woodcuts. His interest in art, nature, and mathematics as well as his phenomenal skill are clearly seen in *Melencolia I*.

Dürer's understanding of melancholy drew from the writings of Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499), a prominent Italian philosopher. Ficino saw both pluses and minuses to the condition's tendency to stimulate thought and emotion. Melancholy could drive one mad. Yet it also produced the sensitivity required for creativity. Ficino wrote, “All truly outstanding men, whether distinguished in philosophy, in statecraft, in poetry or in the arts, are melancholics.”

Dürer specified *Melencolia I*, or the first form of melancholy. He must have known treatises by German author of the occult, Cornelius Agrippa (1486–1535). Agrippa divided melancholy into three levels. Level One ruled the imagination, especially of artists. Level Two controlled scientists and physicians. Level Three governed the spirit and thought of theologians.

*Melencolia I* may be Dürer's psychological self-portrait. The large, wide-eyed angel is saddened by its ability to envision ideals forms, knowing they are unrealizable in the physical world. Even the physical realization of Dürer's ideal geometric solid is chipped and weathered. The shut-eyed putto, a less ambitious artist, can freely scribble away.
