Following WWI, the demographics of German citizens changed, resulting in smaller families and an increase of women in the workforce. There was a great need for low-income housing that met the needs of the changing society. The city of Frankfurt am Main hired Ernst May, a modernist architect, to lead the construction for the housing project called “Neues Frankfurt” (The New Frankfurt).

The goal was to create living spaces that were affordable yet fully equipped—attainable for even the lowest-paid workers. The modernist aesthetic of subtractive design enabled this massive project to be completed in the cheapest and most efficient manner: the standardization and innovation of building materials cut costs and time, e.g., pre-cast concrete panels and prefabricated components.

The Frankfurt kitchen in the MIA’s collection comes from the Höhenblick Estate Housing complex. Built in 1926, it is one of thirteen housing developments designed by German architect Ernst May. Over 10,000 units included a Frankfurt kitchen.
