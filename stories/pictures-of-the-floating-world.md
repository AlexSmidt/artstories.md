The Buddhist concept of *ukiyo* used to mean a “sorrowful world,” where nothing lasts forever. But sometime around the 1620s, the urban residents of Edo (now Tokyo) turned *ukiyo* on its head—it came to mean a “floating world,” where fleeting sensual delights were enjoyed as if each day were the last. And *ukiyo-e*, or “pictures of the floating world,” emerged as a new art form celebrating the sensual pleasures of life.

Edo transformed from a small fishing village in 1457 into a metropolis of nearly a million people some 200 years later, thanks to its role as the seat of power for the Tokugawa shogunate, the military government. A flourishing merchant class amassed great wealth but found itself at the bottom of a highly regulated social order.

"Sumptuary laws" controlled how people dressed, where they lived, and other personal habits. It was only in the theater and brothel zone that the merchant class had some freedom, indulging in the pleasures of the "Floating World." Stylish courtesans and other entertainers who worked in the zone became celebrity trendsetters, eventually even among the higher classes.

Demand for “pictures of the floating world” was so great it fueled new printing technologies that permitted the mass production of images. One painting took a considerable length of time to produce, but hundreds could be made in the form of a woodblock print.

When Japan opened to foreigners in 1854, prints travelled easily to European audiences. Western artists were eager to try some of the innovations of the *ukiyo-e* artists. In this print, for instance, Mary Cassatt deliberately followed their example after her visit to a Paris exhibition of *ukiyo-e*. Other artists of the day, including Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, and Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, also felt their influences.
