Bacon claimed that his pope paintings had nothing to do with religion. Instead, he was simply obsessed with Diego Velázquez’s 1650 portrait of Pope Innocent X, an extraordinarily lifelike and revealing depiction. Not that Bacon ever saw it in person: he worked from photographs pinned to his studio walls. And when he had a chance to see it in person, in 1954, he “felt reluctant” to do so, fearing to confront the “reality of the Velázquez after [his] tampering with it.”

Bacon’s fondness for multiple portraits was undoubtedly inspired by photography. He was fascinated by Eadweard Muybridge’s photographic studies of people in motion, which capture the split-second differences in single actions, like the frames of a film—or his paintings.

The pope’s screaming mouth, shattered pince-nez glasses, and bloodied eye were inspired by the image of a nursemaid, shot through the eye during a civilian massacre, from Sergei Eisenstein’s classic 1925 film Battleship Potemkin. Bacon always kept a photograph of the image, a compelling metaphor for a world turned upside down by war, in his successive studios.

Bacon was also inspired by Titian’s Portrait of Filippo Archinto, in which a mysterious veil or curtain obscures half of the painting, blurring the subject. Bacon duplicates this smeared appearance, extending the curtain across the entire painting. His explanation: “I wanted to paint a head as if folded in on itself, like the folds of a curtain.”
