Tapestry weaving emerged in Europe as a highly developed and coveted art form in the Middle Ages, between 1000 and 1300. They were full of images, much like paintings, but unlike paintings they could be easily rolled and stored or transported. This portability suited the lifestyle of their wealthy owners, who moved from estate to estate throughout the year. Yet they took more labor to produce than paintings and were more costly as a result.

All tapestries are hand-woven textiles. Like most fabrics woven on a loom, they contain warp thread (the lengthwise threads that are tightly stretched on the loom frame before weaving begins) and weft threads (the crosswise threads that pass over and under the warps). What distinguishes tapestries from other woven fabrics is that the weft threads are always inserted by hand, and they do not travel across the full width of the textile but are manipulated back and forth by the weaver so they traverse only a particular section of warp threads. The weaver “paints” an image by inserting different sections of variously colored weft threads in accordance with a design.

In Europe, two basic kinds of looms were used to create tapestries: the low-warp loom and the high-warp loom. With a high-warp loom, the warp threads were stretched vertically. As the weaver worked, he or she sat upright, face-to-face with the warp threads.

This image shows a weaver at a high-warp loom. In his right hand is a shuttle, a device used to hold a weft of a particular color. The pointed end of the shuttle ensured the weft moved accurately over and under the warp threads as the weaver worked it back and forth. Various shuttles hang from the unfinished tapestry. These held other colors required for the design. With this style of loom, the cartoon would often be placed on the wall behind the weaver. In order to reference the cartoon for details regarding color, a mirror was located behind the warp threads. The weaver would look through the warp threads into the mirror to see a reflection of the cartoon.

In low-warp weaving, the loom was oriented horizontally and the seated weaver looked down on the warp threads. This image shows weavers side-by-side at a low-warp loom. This method had the advantage of a system of pulleys operated by foot pedals that pulled up alternating warp threads. This created spaces between the warps and facilitated the passing of the weft thread, freeing up both hands for weaving, and speeding up production. In this method, large strips of the cartoon were often cut up and inserted directly onto the loom frame, so the weaver looked not at a reflection but directly at the cartoon.
