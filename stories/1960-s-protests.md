On August 7, 1971, Vancouver citizens organized a smoke-in to protest the illegal status of marijuana. The police responded less peacefully.  Police officers were accused of arbitrary beatings with riot batons as well as charging on horseback. What was intended as a peaceful event became known as the Gastown Riots.
