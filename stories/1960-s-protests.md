Peace, love, and protest could have been the motto of the 1960s and early 70s, a time defined by people questioning the organized structures they lived under—government, religion, and even age and race.  Protests were organized by people in order to voice opposition to some rule which they were powerless to prevent or avoid otherwise.  Through the practice of uniting in collective voice and action, protests have and still continue to call into question and change the policies and practices of ruling structures.

The month of May 1968 in Paris—known as “May 68”—was marked by groups of students protesting against capitalism, consumerism and traditional institutions, values and order.  They sought to reestablish the government into a more people-oriented system.  Despite its political efforts, May 1968 is said to have succeeded “as a social movement, not as a political one.”

While under control of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia underwent the Prague Spring—an attempt to gain rights for citizens concerning freedom of media, speech, and travel.  However, the only change that survived the end of the Spring was the splitting of the Czechoslovakian territory into two republics—the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.

United States involvement in the Vietnam War was highly contested by the public.  Resistance stemmed from an overwhelming opposition to the commissioned draft as well as the people’s reaction to the media’s portrayal of the events in Vietnam.  Conflicting feelings led to years of protests, sit-ins, and marches against US involvement as well as this image showing the polarized groups of the American people.

On August 7, 1971, citizens of the Vancouver area organized not a sit-in, but a smoke-in to protest the illegal status of marijuana.  The police responded less peacefully.  Police officers were accused of arbitrary beatings with riot batons as well as using horse-back charges on crowds of onlookers and tourists.  What became known as The Gastown Riots, while intended as a peaceful Smoke-in, was later observed as a police riot.
