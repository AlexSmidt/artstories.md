The work of French tradesmen was strictly regulated by the guild system that had dominated the organization of European towns since medieval times. Baer’s hometown of Strasbourg, on France’s border with Germany, had 20 different guilds. The Echasse guild served goldsmiths, painters, and printers.

Like all prospective silversmiths, Baer would have served eight years as an apprentice, followed by two or three years as a journeyman. Then he would have been ready to submit his “masterpiece” for judging in order to join the guild as a master. Once accepted, he would stamp his “hall-mark” on every piece he made. But since he wasn’t yet a master when he made this cup, it bears no hallmark.

Not much is known about Johann Friedrich Baer, save for the record of his masterpiece submission to the Echasse guild. Very little of his other work survives—not unusual, since silver objects back then were often melted down and turned into something more fashionable or converted into coin. All the more remarkable, then, that the museum also owns this portrait of Baer with his masterpiece.
