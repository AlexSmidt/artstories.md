The idea that art could be made from anything was first proposed by the agitators of the so-called Dada movement, who felt that the intellectual arbiters of good taste had foolishly led Europe into World War I. Marcel Duchamp’s Fountain, a urinal purchased at a local plumbing store, caused a stir in 1917.

The Cubists are best known for shattering the illusion of space as seen from a single viewpoint. But they also came up with collage as an art form, pasting a wide variety of materials into their pictures. They liked that pasted paper, irrefutably flat, resisted the suggestion of three-dimensional space. But they also played with contradictions that arose between art and life. Here, for example, Picasso has formed a wine bottle from a newspaper clipping about military tensions leading up to World War I.

Abstract Expressionism, which exalted the inner life of the artist while eschewing any resemblance to the real world, dominated the art scene in the mid-1950s. The expressionist brushstroke, a sign of the artist’s hand, became cliché and was ironically rendered by Lichtenstein in his trademark style mimicking mass production. The irony actually goes deeper when you consider that his art wasn’t mass-produced but sold only in limited editions.
