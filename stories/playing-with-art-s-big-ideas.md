The anti-art Dada agitators, angry with the intellectual set that had led Europe into World War I, were the first to suggest that art could be made from anything. Marcel Duchamp’s *Fountain*, a urinal purchased at a local plumbing store, caused a stir in 1917.

The Cubists are best known for shattering the illusion of space as seen from a single viewpoint, but they also innovated the use of collage as an art form, pasting a wide variety of materials into their pictures. They appreciated the way pasted paper—irrefutably flat—resists the suggestion of three-dimensional space. But they also played with contradictions that arose between art and life. Here, for example, Picasso has formed a wine bottle from a newspaper clipping about military tensions leading up to World War I.

Abstract Expressionism—which exalted the inner life of the artist and eschewed any resemblance to the physical world--dominated the art scene across the country in the mid 1950s. The cherished brushstroke, a sign of the expressionist artist’s hand, had become its own cliché, ironically rendered here by Lichenstein in his trademark style mimicking mass production. And the paradox goes deeper—far from being mass-produced, his picture is actually a one-of-a-kind piece of fine art (or at least one of a limited edition of fine art prints).
