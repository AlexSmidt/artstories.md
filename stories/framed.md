Girodet reused the frame from his first portrait of Lange, but replaced the four corner medallions—allegories referring to the actress’s beauty and talent—with satirical emblems.

The medallion on the upper left of the frame has a Latin inscription: *Desinit in esinit piscem muiler formosa superne (*A lovely woman on the top ends in a fish below) and an image of a siren with a mirror: vain, duplicitious seduction.

The medallion on the upper right is inscribed in Latin: *Risum teneatis amici*? (Are you supressing a laugh, friends?) Above the inscription is a strange composite creature: the head of the ostrich refers to the actress's voracity, the tail of the turkey to her stupidity, the bird feet to her swampy origins. The head with the ram horns alludes to Lange's husband, while the other suggests an older man, presumably her father-in-law, who had tried to prevent their marriage due to her reputation. Finally, the squirrel driving the beast symbolized the agility with which the actress dominated both men.

The medallion on the lower left refers to Lange’s greed and excessive desire. Butterflies, attracted by flowers and gold, are captioned in Latin: *Trahit sua quemque voluptas* (Each man’s desire leads him on).

The last medallion on the lower right ridicules the actress's pretension with an image from La Fontaine's fable: *The frog that wanted to be as big as the ox*. It’s ironically contrasted with the motto of King Louis XIV: *Nec pluribus impar* (Not inferior to any). The message? Lange was the equal of a king, in her eyes only.
