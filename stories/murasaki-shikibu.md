Murasaki Shikibu was a celebrated Japanese novelist, poet, and lady-in-waiting at the Imperial Court during Japan’s Heian Period (794 to 1185).  She is best known for writing *The Tale of Genji*, considered by some to be the first novel ever written.  Like many other great artists, Murasaki is attributed with being pretentious, awkward, and difficult to approach.  While this depiction of Murasaki comes from a variety of sources, she was a “forceful personality” as well as a talented writer.

Murasaki had an unconventional youth growing up in her father’s home and learning Chinese.  Women of Murasaki’s time, thought to be incapable of real intelligence, were usually not educated in Chinese characters, but instead used a developing script called kana which was based on abbreviating Chinese characters.  Murasaki’s interest, however, surpassed conventions and she grew to become proficient in Classical Chinese and Chinese literature.  Her skill did not dispel notions on women’s intelligence, however, and only led her father to disappointedly exclaim, “Just my luck… What a pity she was not born a man!”

In her mid-twenties Murasaki married her second cousin, Fujiwara Nobutaka.  Nobutaka died two years after the birth of their only child during the Cholera epidemic.  According to legend, after her husband’s death Murasaki retreated to Ishiyama Temple in central Japan.  On a late summer night, while gazing at the moon, she was supposedly inspired to write *The Tale of Genji*.  Tis story of her retreat is simply myth but became a popular subject for Japanese artists who portray her at the temple looking to the moon for inspiration.

Because of her growing reputation as a writer, Murasaki was later invited to become a lady-in-waiting at the Imperial court.  Although it was highly fashionable, court life could also be corrupt, as exemplified in some of the antics played out by Prince Genji in Murasaki’s tale.  Court women lived in seclusion and were known only by nicknames, including Murasaki Shikibu, whose real name remains a mystery.  Entertainment was found in popular pastimes like having love affairs, writing poetry, and keeping diaries.  Murasaki was not the only writer at court and some of the literature written by court women is credited today as being among the earliest and best written work in the Japanese canon.

Murasaki is credited with producing three works: *The Tale of Genji*, *The Diary of Lady Murasaki* and *Poetic Memoirs*, a collection of 128 poems.  She is most well-known for *The Tale of Genji*, which is thought to have taken a decade to complete.  *Genji* is celebrated as a great depiction of the human spirit.  One translator, Helen Craig McCullough, writes, “…Murasaki Shikibu's unique genius has made the work for many a powerful statement of human relationships, the impossibility of permanent happiness in love ... and the vital importance, in a world of sorrows, of sensitivity to the feelings of others."

Speculation surrounds the year of Murasaki’s death.  Scholars debate between 1014, the year of her father’s hasty return to Kyoto perhaps prompted by her death, to as late as 1025.  Within a century of her death, Murasaki was deemed a classical writer and today she is recognized as having written the first novel—ever.  In 2008, the 1,000 year anniversary of The Tale of Genji, the city of Kyoto hosted a year-long celebration of Murasaki’s beloved story.
