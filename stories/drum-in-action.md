An *ōtsuzumi *drum is assembled before every performance, and taken apart afterwards. This is how the core is wrapped. The skin of an *ōtsuzumi *drum must be kept very dry. The skins are often left to dry near a *hibachi*, a traditional Japanese furnace, for an hour before a performance.

The *ōtsuzumi  *is the larger of the two Noh drums, the *kotsuzumi* is the smaller. They look remarkably similar but have drastically different sounds. The *ōtsuzumi* actually creates the higher pitched sounds due to the fact that the animal skins that form the drum surface are kept very dry. The *kotsuzumi* skins are kept damp and therefore produce lower sounds. The *kotsuzumi* is played on the shoulder rather than the hip.
