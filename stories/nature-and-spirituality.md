Why did Van Gogh paint so many olive and cypress trees? Van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, and fellow painter Emile Bernard talked of creating art that consoles using imagery of “a purer and more serene nature,” instead of religious imagery. He wanted to show it was possible to paint the meaning of Christ in the Garden of Olives, the garden of Gethsemane where Christ prayed the night before his crucifixion, “without aiming straight for the historical Garden of Gethsemane.”

Gauguin sent Van Gogh a letter in early November 1889 with a sketch of his just-completed painting, *Christ in the Garden of Olives*. He had given the figure of Christ his own facial features and Van Gogh’s hair coloration. The palette is vividly unnatural, and Gauguin acknowledged that the canvas “isn’t destined to be understood.”

Van Gogh distrusted modern religious painting as much as he distrusted modern religious institutions. “I’m not an admirer of Gauguin’s *Christ in the Garden of Olives*,” he wrote. “If I remain here, I wouldn’t try to paint a *Christ in the Garden of Olives*, but in fact the olive picking as it is still seen today, and then giving the correct proportions of the human figure in it.” Painting the olive trees was the closest he came to painting religious imagery in the final years of his life.

At the same time that he began painting the olive groves surrounding the asylum, he began to paint the cypress trees that dotted the grounds. He was completely captivated, writing, “…it astonishes me that they have not been done as I see them. They are beautiful in line and proportion like an Egyptian obelisk. And the green has such a distinguished quality.”

In classical traditions, cypresses had symbolic associations with death and the god of the underworld. In Mediterranean countries, it’s planted in cemeteries as a symbol of immortality—it’s long-lived, gives off a sweet smell, stays green year round, and its wood does not decay. The tree is forever reaching upward, to the heavens, connecting the earthly and celestial realms.

Trees had very personal meanings to Van Gogh, as ascertained by scholars studying his paintings. The olive tree evoked the spiritual meaning of Van Gogh’s personal struggles, as well as the enduring tradition and essence of Provence. The cypress tree is believed to represent the artist’s desire for spiritual consolation after death and build on the tree’s association with immortality and, conversely, mortality.
