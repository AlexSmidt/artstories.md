Polykleitos claimed to have calculated the perfect human proportions, and a lot of Western artists have agreed. But sculptures are not real people, and the fact that this ideal man is easy on the eyes may owe more to the sculptor’s poetic license and aesthetic vision than anatomical accuracy.

The great artists of the Renaissance absorbed Polykleitos’ rules, and then broke them. They weren’t interested in sculpting or painting models of perfect people but works of art, bent to their aesthetic goals. Michelangelo’s David (1501–04), for instance, would be considered a monster if he came to life and walked through downtown Florence: his head and torso are vastly out of proportion with the rest of his body. But the sculpture was made to perch atop a cathedral—viewers would see it from far below. So Michelangelo compensated by making the upper body larger in proportion to the lower.

Or take Botticelli’s The Birth of Venus (1486), another masterpiece of Renaissance art. Venus, the goddess of beauty, looks like she’s made of Silly Putty. Her left shoulder has turned boneless and droopy, while her left arm is so long she could scratch her knee without bothering to bend over. Yet Venus on the half shell is the very picture of beauty, more alluring than any Bond Girl on silk sheets.

Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres added vertebrae to his La Grande Odalisque (1814), as though his elongated figure of a harem woman was anatomically correct. A study by French physician, comparing the dimensions of human models to those in the painting, confirmed it’s not—her back is longer by nearly five vertebrae.
