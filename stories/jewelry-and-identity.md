Jewelry in India connects the wearer to a community while at the same time allowing for personal style. Regional, religious, and community differences all influence jewelry design. We present a few examples from different regions of India on these next few pages.

Here, a bride from West Bengal wears a traditional crown made of shola pith bark, layered and carved into ornaments.

Jewelry often displays marital status, as demonstrated in this photo of a married woman from Gujarat in northwestern India. While women of all ages can wear a circular nose ring in her left nostril, the 16 upper-arm and twelve lower-arm ivory bangles in addition to other bangles of gold and glass denote her married status. The woman’s nasal septum piercing might also connote her marital status, and some of her necklaces probably were wedding gifts.

Heavy *pambadam* earrings are associated with South India. In Tamil, *pambu* means “snake,” and these earrings are associated with snakes as symbols of protection and fertility. The abstract shapes of the earring are fashioned individually, and named for anatomical features of the snake. The entire fabrication process takes around 7 to 10 days.

 

Many sculptures depict the gods with stretched earlobes, and nearly all women from Tamil Nadu stretched their earlobes until missionaries began to eradicate this fashion in the 19th century. Although the missionaries were not completely successful, stretched earlobes have become less common.
