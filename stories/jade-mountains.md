The jade mountain form became popular in the 1700s after new sources of nephrite jade from the mountains and rivers of Khotan, in present-day Xinjiang province, became available to the Qing court.

There are two main types of jade mountains: the miniature mountains carved from small, smooth pebbles found in rivers, and the big boulders quarried from mountains.

The largest jade mountain ever made is more than seven feet high and weighs 11,684 pounds. It depicts the legendary ruler of ancient China, Yu the Great, leading his people to control a flood. Completed in 1787, it took three years to transport the jade boulder from Xinjiang to Beijing to the imperial workshop in Yangzhou, plus six years to carve and two years of final polishing.
