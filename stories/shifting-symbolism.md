Lucretia’s story is a sordid tale. Away on a military expedition, her husband boasted to his comrades that his wife was the most virtuous of all their wives. Indeed, a surprise visit at home found her chastely weaving with her maids. Among the visiting comrades was Sextus Tarquinius, son of the tyrannical king of Rome. He slipped into her room and gave her two choices: sleep with him, or be killed with one of her slaves to make it look like an adulterous affair. Lucretia choose the first option. The next day, she summoned her husband and father, told them what had happened, and fatally stabbed herself to redeem her honor. Full of grief and anger, they swore to avenge her death, and the ensuing revolt allegedly led to the founding of the Roman Republic.

Interest in the story of Lucretia exploded around 1500 with the discovery of a fragment of an ancient statue—now lost—thought to be Lucretia. Even the pope wrote a poem about her, glorifying her chastity and virtue, and Lucretia became a popular name for girls.

Some artists were drawn to the political overtones of the story. Here, for example, the Renaissance painter Sandro Botticelli places the action in a public square—less focused on the death of Lucretia than the birth of the Roman Republic.

Painters of the Baroque period were thrill-seekers, chasing after moments of intense emotion and sensuality, so many of them focused on Lucretia’s rape as a dramatic erotic encounter.

Rembrandt’s Lucretia is striking for what he leaves out of the picture—no rapist, no grief-stricken avengers, not a hint of nudity. Instead, he quietly mixes the profound emotions—pride, shame, regret—that Lucretia appears to stoically contain just beneath the surface.
