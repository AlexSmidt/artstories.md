Mines in the Andes Mountains of South America yield gold, silver, tin and platinum. Metalsmiths fashioned prestige goods from these precious metals since around 2000 BCE. Goldworking technology and techniques that originated in the Andes made their way northward via trade routes to Central America.

While the people of ancient Peru did not value gold as money, its symbolic connection to the sun gave whoever possessed it powerful spiritual currency.

The MIA occasionally hears from concerned visitors that the ear spools appear tarnished, and therefore must not be “real.” Like most ancient gold from Mesoamerica and South America, they are made from an alloy of gold, copper and silver that the Spaniards called *tumbaga*. They corrode from exposure to the air and need to be cleaned periodically.

Spanish conquistadors thought they’d been duped. When melting down their booty they discovered that what they thought was pure gold was not. An alloy comprised of gold and copper was treated with acidic plant juice and crocodile dung to leach out the copper and leave an extremely thin layer of gold on the surface.

This portrait of the last Inca king Atahualpa (ruled 1532-1533) shows he's dripping in gold. You might wonder why, if gold ornaments were so abundant in the ancient Andes, there aren't tons of examples in museums? Short answer: the conquistadors destroyed it. It's estimated that between March and July of 1533, forty thousand pounds—or 20 tons—of Inca gold was gathered up, melted down and shipped back to Spain.
