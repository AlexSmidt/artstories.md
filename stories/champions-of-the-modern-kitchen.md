Americans Catherine Beecher and Christine Frederick (1883-1970) both considered improving kitchen design. In the 1870s, Beecher proposed integrated components and continuous work surfaces; in the early 1900s, Frederick studied kitchen efficiency—how people move through the space and use equipment--and reorganized the space to better suit common tasks. Both published their ideas promoting home management and hygiene.

Frankfurt kitchens designer  Schütte-Lihotzky studied train dining cars, ship galleys, and the studies of Christine Frederick. She knew that to reduce the burden of household work, every space must be utilized in the most logical, hygienic, and efficient manner—like a laboratory or factory. The kitchen was solely a food preparation space: metal surfaces allowed for easy cleaning; beech wood counters prevented bacteria; and a large window provided ventilation and fresh air. And everything was within arm’s reach, to saved the homeowner valuable time.
