Forget awkward, improvised toasts. If you want to wish a Somali couple well, you write them a poem. And not just a few lines. Minnesota resident Fadumo Ali is famous for her wedding poetry, like this excerpt from her 2008 poem, translated into English by Said Mohammed.

*Sweet words, smooth love and open hands*\
 *Beautiful behavior, sweetness and success*\
 *May God give them to you and make them your partners*\
 *And may luck be on your side and time help you out*

*Like the Nairus festival or a downpour in the Nugal \[Valley\]*\
 *Like the green pastures where the fat livestock is grazing*\
 *Good prospects, mercy of God and victory*\
 *The ease of prosperity, and expectations of good things*\
 *May God provide you with his kindness*\
 *May you stay in peace of mind all your lives*

*Clouds of prosperity, a full beaker and fortunate deeds*\
 *Wonderful kids without any shortcomings*\
 *The forefront parents of yours who were sought by all*\
 *\[Be\] like them a lighthouse not swaying aside*\
 *Good inheritance from your ancestorsâ€™ path*\
 *With wealth and general progress*\
 *Oh, Lord! Give them your bounty and affluence.*
