The first poem reads:

Though the west lake swells with water as spring arrives, \
the emerald bamboo outdoors blocks the sight of boats. \
Had the east wind facilitated his quest, \
he would have returned by boat in moonlight to the frosted land of Wu faraway.\
Signed: Kakyō Kansho Dōjin Kentō

The original Chinese:

西泊春來雖水肥\
碧湘門外掩船扉\
東風若為斯郎便\
一髮吳霜棹月歸\
佳境甘蔗道人乾瞳

The identity of “he” here is entirely unclear, but the final couplet is an allusion to a Tang Dynasty poem, “Red Cliff,” the subject of another artwork at Mia. Like the painting, the poem itself, though penned by a Japanese Buddhist priest, refers to a Chinese subject—and it’s written in Chinese too.

The second poem reads:

Floating in a houseboat on the brimming spring river,\
what could one desire in a sound sleep after mooring?\
In nothing but insouciant boating would I spend the rest of my life,\
with mountains along the white gull-dotted stream as my beauties.\
Signed: Zenfukusan Shōchū

And the Chinese:

春水滔天屋檨浮\
泊船栽睡所何求\
殘生只付風流檝\
山是美人江白鷗\
前福山昌忠

The signatures and seals of the two inscriptions identify the inscribers as successive abbots of the temple Kenchōji in Kamakura, Yōkoku Kentō (the 169th abbot) and Teihō Shōchū (the 170th). Established in 1253, Kenchōji was one of Japan’s first Zen monasteries.
