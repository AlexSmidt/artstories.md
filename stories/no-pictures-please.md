Marco Breuer, as seen—or not seen, rather—in this video of *New Pictures 2: Marco Breuer* opening at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts in 2010, makes a conscious effort not to have his picture taken. He is interested in what defines a photograph, but not in being defined by photography. He wants viewers to focus on his photographs as images, not to perceive his imprint on them.

In the exhibition, Breuer calls attention to things like outlets, security cameras, exhibition titles, promotional materials, and artist descriptions, subverting the usual blank, white space of galleries and inspiring new connections with the art.
