If you’ve ever been to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York, you’ve encountered “William.” This sweet blue hippo, decorated with lotus blossoms and marsh plants, represents an ancient Egyptian tribute to the aquatic mammal. The ancient Egyptians recognized the complex nature of hippos. In many ways, hippos are like William—portly, watchful, and benign—and in many others they are the opposite: powerful, territorial, and deadly.

The deadliness of hippos is embodied by Ammut, the devourer of souls. With a body that was part lion, part hippopotamus, and part crocodile, she was not worshipped but feared. Along with Maat, Ammut was one of the first deities the deceased encountered in the underworld. As the goddess of truth, Maat judged the dead. And since Egyptians believed that bad deeds weigh heavily on the heart, a person’s heart was weighed against Maat’s feather of truth in the underworld: a light heart earned immortality, a heavy heart meant eternal damnation—and the feeding of the heart to Ammut.

A hippo’s tusk is deadly, but it’s also a symbol of sexual virility and fertility—the reason that Taweret, the goddess of maternity and protector of women in childbirth, was depicted as a pregnant hippo. Her image adorned amulets and household objects associated with childbirth, such as beds. She is often shown holding a fish-shaped hieroglyph called “sa,” which meant protection, underscoring her role as a guardian.
