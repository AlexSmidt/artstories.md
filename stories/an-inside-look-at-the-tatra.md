The MIA’s Tatra was bought in Brussels, Belgium, in 1948, and exported to Canada in the 1950s. With Czechoslovakia, where the car was made, under Soviet rule, parts were hard to come by. The exterior has been repainted, but no known Tatra T87 has its original paint. Only worn parts of the engine and transaxle have been replaced.

The Tatra company’s advertising stressed its speed, power, and streamlined design, as seen on the cover of the 1948 Tatra T87 sales brochure.
