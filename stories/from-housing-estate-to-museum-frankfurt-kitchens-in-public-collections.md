The Frankfurt kitchens functioned well until the late 20th century, when the MIA’s was likely removed. It came from the Höhenblick Estate Housing complex relatively intact. Conservator Randy Bohn removed several layers of paint, revealing the original darkened blue. The cabinet to the right of the sink (second photo below) has a grate for what appeared to be some kind of meat storage.

London’s Victoria and Albert Museum has a kitchen from the same housing estate as the MIA. Slightly smaller, it was the most common and least costly, and included a pocket door connecting the kitchen and dining area. Museums in New York and Vienna have the same version. Variations with a pass-through instead of a door, like the MIA’s, may have been for households with paid help.
