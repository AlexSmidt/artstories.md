The Frankfurt kitchens functioned well until the late 20th century, when the MIA’s was likely removed. It came from the Höhenblick Estate Housing complex relatively intact. Conservator Randy Bohn removed several layers of paint, revealing the original darkened blue. The cabinet to the right of the sink (second photo below) has a grate for what appeared to be some kind of meat storage.
