Early photographers tried to take pictures that looked like paintings. By the late 1960s, painters were trying to reproduce photographs. Rejecting the painterly abstraction that had dominated the art scene in the 1940s and ’50s, its obsession with movement and the physical properties of paint, Photorealists craved the static, objective reality captured by a camera lens—literally “what we see.”

The Photorealists were more focused on meticulously approximating the look of photos than any particular subject matter, and ranged from portraits to still lifes to advertising images to scenes from everyday life. They employed various mechanical aids: grids, projectors, airbrushes, transfer paper—whatever helped them reproduce the photographic look in another artistic medium.
