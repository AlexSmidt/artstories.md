Duluth as Chicago? It was a timber boomtown in the 1880s and 1890s, and the William Prindle Company was encouraging real estate investment by Easterners. Investors were convinced it would be the next Great Lakes metropolis when rail cargo from the Pacific was shipped from its Lake Superior port.

William Hunt designed the Prindle house in 1905, on Greysolon Road overlooking Lake Superior. Bradstreet helped with details on some of the windows and other exterior surfaces. The house still stands today.
