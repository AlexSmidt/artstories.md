The Nataraja form has been differently interpreted, with one version suggesting it symbolizes both Shiva’s creation (the drum) and destruction (the fire) of the world during the cosmic cycle. His open palm gives protection to devotees and his raised foot offers release and enlightenment, while his planted foot shelters the soul. The dwarf symbolizes ignorance. Through his dance, Shiva delivers the soul of the devotee from the bondage of ignorance.

The prevalence of Nataraja iconography in Indian art has several possible explanations. The dancing form of Shiva was said to dwell in Chidambaram, an important South Indian religious center. Around 900, South Indian royalty began founding temples with Nataraja images carved into the exterior, to align themselves with the powerful religious authority of Chidambaram.

Another interpretation springs from the cobras that encircle Shiva’s arms as living jewelry and from the name for his raised leg position: “frightened by a snake.” Cobras are symbols of protection and fecundity, and Shiva is associated with cremation grounds, deserted places where venomous snakes are said to slither freely.
