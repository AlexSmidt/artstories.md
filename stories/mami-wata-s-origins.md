Mami Wata has her origins in Africa’s early encounters with the West. She took the form of a light-skinned water spirit and was added to the ancient pantheon of water deities. This particular incarnation of Mami Wata, however, has its roots in an actual woman: a Samoan snake charmer who traveled to Hamburg, Germany, in the 1880s with the stage name of Maladamatjaute.

Maladamatjaute performed in a traveling “people show” that presented exotic entertainers to curious Europeans. The shows were advertised with colorful posters depicting the performers, including Maladamatjaute, and African sailors on merchant ships docked in Hamburg brought some of these posters back to Africa.

How did Maladamatjaute achieve instant stardom in Africa? She was sexy, for one thing, in a dangerous kind of way (snakes will have that effect). And for African men, displaying the image of an exotic foreign woman like Maladamatjaute may have been a badge of worldliness. But she also resonated with millennia-old spirituality. Water spirits, associated with wealth and health in much of Africa, are often depicted with snake or fish-like qualities—like a mermaid. Maladamatjaute was portrayed on the advertising poster from the mid-thigh up, allowing Africans to imagine her fish tail.

Malamatjaute, reconceived as Mami Wata the water spirit, was practically an overnight sensation. Sculptures modeled on the poster image appeared at least as early as 1901, when British agent J.A. Green took this photograph of a water spirit headdress in southeastern Nigeria.

Sensing a business opportunity, German perfumer Dralle developed “Mami Water” for the African market around 1920.

During the 1950s, several Ghana-based merchants also sensed money to be made, and sent the original German poster of Malamatjaute to the Shree Ram Calendar Company in India, which copied it for sale in Africa. The costume of the MIA’s Mami Wata figure is copied almost directly from the poster, suggesting the artist had a poster on hand.

And the MIA figure has at least one sister, made by the same carver in 1953. A 1999 photo shows a man holding a Mami Wata wearing identical shoes and a very similar bodice. But wait a minute, doesn’t she look like Queen Elizabeth II, “Mother of the British Empire”?
