In Shinto tradition, spirits—or *kami*—are everywhere in nature. The earliest Shinto shrines were great trees or other natural objects near sacred areas. The *kami* would be inclined to take up residence in these dwellings of the divine and protect their nearby worshippers.

The most important elements of a Shinto shrine are the *kami* (spirit) it enshrines and the *shintai* that houses it. A *shintai* can be a natural form, such as a rock, mountain, or waterfall, or a man-made object like swords, jewels, or mirrors. The *Deer Mandala* includes two forms of *shintai*—Mount Mikasa in the distance and the disk (or maybe a mirror) carried by the deer.

Shinto shrines were not usually permanent structures until after the arrival of Buddhism around 552. Shrines often arose near the new Buddhist temples, part of the process of reconciling the new relition with native Japanese beliefs. Kasuga is linked with the Kōfukuji Temple in Nara.

The Kasuga complex has shrines for five central deities and many more minor ones. The shrine in this photo is for Izanagi-no-mikoto, worshipped as a god who gives people long lives.

The Kasuga shrine complex was built in 768, and since then it has been rebuilt or refreshed every 20 years, following the same plan.
