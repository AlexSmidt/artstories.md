As the title of *Some/One* suggests, Do Ho Suh in interested in the individual versus collective identities. Many of these other pieces continue his investigation on the limits of personal powers and collective forces. In his 1997 piece “Floor” thousands of tiny plastic figures hold up a piece of glass.

In other pieces, like “Karma”, Do Ho Suh examines the relationship between collectivity and anonymity. Here the small figures are seemingly running ahead to support and anticipate the steps of the figure descending from the ceiling.

Do-Ho Suh’s work challenges museum spaces both in terms of scale, as with “Karma,” and with viewer interaction, as with “Floor” in which museum visitors are encouraged to walk across the piece. As such, the pieces call into question how our bodies occupy public spaces and interrogate the meaning of personal space.
