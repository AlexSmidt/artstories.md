Western artists from the 1400s to the mid-1800s seized on any technological innovation to make their art more lifelike. The discovery of oil paint, which permitted fine modulations in color and detail, led to great strides toward realism.

Artists used the mathematical theories of perspective developed in Renaissance Italy to produce scenes that appear to recede in space. Leonardo da Vinci developed a “perspectograph” machine to help with this, and Albrecht Dürer included illustrations of several similar devices in his 1525 book The Artist’s Manual.

Impressionist painters in the 1800s were inspired by optical science and the new field of color theory, the study of how light is reflected or absorbed. Monet, Seurat, and Pissarro all experimented with different ways to recreate these effects with paint. Steinkamp, in turn, was inspired by these Impressionist efforts to represent the light that reveals form, rather than the form itself.
