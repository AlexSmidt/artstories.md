Mathematical theories of perspective developed in Renaissance Italy provided artists with an understanding of how to produce scenes that appear to recede in space. Leonardo da Vinci developed a “perspectograph” machine, and Albrecht Durer included illustrations of several similar devices in his 1525 book, “The Artist’s Manual.”

Impressionist painters in the 1800s found creative inspiration in optical science and the new field of color theory, which studied how light is reflected or absorbed. Artists like Monet, Seurat, and Pissarro experimented with different ways to recreate these effects with paint. Steinkamp counts Impressionist efforts to represent light, rather than form, among the inspirations for her own work.
