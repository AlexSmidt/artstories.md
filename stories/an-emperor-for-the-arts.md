During his 61-year reign, Emperor Qianlong was an earnest advocate for the arts, as well as an artist himself. More than any other emperor, Qianlong took cultural preservation and cultivation very seriously and became known for building a robust collection of Chinese art.

Like other rulers around the world, Qianlong used art to solidify and communicate his hold on power. For instance, the Siku Quanshu, or Four Treasuries Project, assembled the largest collection of Chinese philosophy, history, and literature into one library collection—while serving to weed out rebellious texts by political rivals. Presumably it was worth the effort of 15,000 copyists working with 36,000 volumes.

Emperor Qianlong himself was the biggest fan of jade in China’s history and the expensive carving of jade mountains was made possible by the political stability and unprecedented prosperity that the emperor oversaw. Demand for finely crafted jade objects rose with the emperor’s endorsement of the form, which he gave here with a seal and poem carved into the surface.
