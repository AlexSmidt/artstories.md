In his animations and contemporary gallery installments, William Kentridge employs music to aid in conveying his messages.  Composer Phillip Miller talks about working with Kentridge and exploring how to add the right sound to the animations that Kentridge had already produced.  He recalls, 

“I worked in a very interesting way with William because it was probably the first and last time I worked quite like that which was that he had finished the film…  I think that when he starts to film he has a kind of rhythm and he can take that idea and play with it with me.”

 Instead of starting with animation and fueling it with music, in another project Kentridge started with music.  Producing the Metropolitan Opera’s 2013 production of The Nose, a satirical Russian opera written in 1928, Kentridge created animation, charcoal drawings, puppets, newspaper clippings and even a large-scale papier-mâché nose for the operatic performance.

Composer Neo Muyanga was born in Soweto, studied music in Italy, and has been a part of several musical endeavors, including the acoustic pop duo blk sonshine and the production of his very own critically acclaimed operetta The Flower of Shembe.  In Second-hand Reading, Muyanga composes a mournful piece to accompany Kentridge’s stop-motion charcoal animation.  He sings about a brutal police massacre that occurred in South Africa.  Through the beautiful notes of the piano complemented by his own singing, Muyanga gives further dimension to the words and pictures we see in Kentridge’s work.
