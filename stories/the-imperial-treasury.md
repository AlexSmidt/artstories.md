The Imperial Treasury is one of the most impressive collections of rare European treasures, amassed by The Hofburg (Castle of the Habsburg Corut), Vienna. It’s located at the Swiss Courtyard, originally rebuilt for the treasury by Ferdinand I, and occupies more than 21 rooms. The vast collection is divided into secular, ecclesiastical (church related), and household items.

The secular collection demonstrates the political power and geographic reach of the Habsburgs. It contains the Austrian Crown Jewels—the vestments and adornments of the Holy Roman Emperor and later the Emperor of Austria, worn at the coronation ceremony and other state functions. “Crown Jewels” generally refers to crowns, scepters, orbs, swords, rings, crosses, holy relics, and royal robes, as well as several other objects connected with the ceremony itself.

The Ecclesiastical Treasury—items related to church—features artifacts used by the Roman Catholic Habsburg family and its court for prayer or religious services. The collection of crosses, icons, relics, and holy statues is so vast that few items remain on permanent view for long as others are cycled in.

The Habsburg household collection contains items for daily use, though not of the sort you’d find at Bed, Bath, and Beyond. Among the few objects regularly on view are the Cradle of the King of Rome, a gift commissioned by the city of Paris for Napoleon and his wife, Empress Marie-Louise, and the emerald Unguentarium, a small container for oils or other liquids or powders.

The two major attractions within the Imperial Treasury are the Ainkhürn (horn of a unicorn) and the Agate Bowl. The horn is most likely that of a narwhal, but legends attributing magical powers of healing to it made it more valuable than gold. The bowl was once believed to be the Holy Grail, once filled with the blood of Jesus Christ at the foot of the cross, since an inscription refers to Jesus.
