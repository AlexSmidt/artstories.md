# [My Kingdom For a Horse!](http://artstories.artsmia.org/#/stories/2275)

The Kingdom of Mali, centrally located among trade routes, dominated West Africa from the 1200s to the 1500s. Mali’s mansas, or kings, grew fabulously wealthy by controlling the region’s trade. Exploiting the kingdom’s own resources didn’t hurt: the south produced almost half the gold of Africa, Europe, and Asia; the north produced salt that was almost as valuable as gold to southern regions.

The Kingdom of Mali’s great wealth supported enormous armies, including the first cavalry troops south of the Sahara. Horses were extremely costly, since animals suitable for the military had to be imported from Arab lands.Their upkeep was expensive, too—one Arab historian tells of a visit to a court where each horse had three servants. Mansa Musa had a standing cavalry of 10,000 horsemen, befitting the ruler’s standing as perhaps the richest man in history—a net worth, adjusted for inflation, of \$400 billion, nearly three times the fortune of Bill Gates.

The *durbar* festival has been held in Kano, Nigeria, every year for seven centuries. Although Kano lies beyond the borders of the Mali kingdom, the festival may offer a hint of the splendor of Mali horsemen in their heyday.
