<p>Osiris was the original mummy. But first, the myth goes, he brought civilization and agriculture to Egypt. And then he was murdered—twice—by his own brother.</p><p>Jealous of Osiris’s popularity, his brother, Seth, killed Osiris and sealed him in a coffin and flung it into the Nile River. The coffin ran aground near the Lebanese city of Byblos, where a sacred tree took root and quickly encased the coffin in its giant trunk. The king of Byblos cut down the tree and used it as a pillar in his palace. (The pillar shape became immortalized in Egyptian culture as the <i>djed</i>, or the “backbone of Osiris,” a symbol of stability on many Egyptian coffins.) Eventually, Osiris’s body was discovered and his wife, Isis, restored him to life.</p><p>Seth later came across Osiris and tore him to pieces, spreading them far and wide. Isis reassembled the body and wrapped it in linen bandages, creating the first mummy. She rose him from the dead once again, but, perhaps wishing to avoid a third murder, Osiris chose to live out his days in the underworld.</p>
