Of all the traditional printmaking techniques, stone lithography offers the best translation of an artist's drawing style, relying on the simple fact that oil and water do not mix. The artist draws an image directly on the stone with a greasy crayon or brush. The stone is wetted with water and covered with oil-based printer's ink, which sticks to the drawing but not to places where the water has soaked into the stone. Using a high-pressure press, an impression is made of the inked image.

Lithography is particularly good at generating strong contrasts of light and dark.

Lithography can produce relatively large editions, making it an ideal technique for printing posters and periodicals. The MIA currently owns some 2,000 Daumier lithographs, most of them once belonging to Sarah Bernhardt, the famous French actress. *Rue Transnonain* was a gift from MIA trustee John E. Andrus III and his wife, Marion.
