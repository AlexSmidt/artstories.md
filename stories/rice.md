Genetic research shows that all forms of Asian rice spring from a single domestication that occurred between 8,200 and 13,500 years ago in China. Asia as a whole is the largest grower and consumer of rice in the world.

In Japan, rice is more than food. It’s an essential part of society, and its cultivation has arguably shaped the country’s cultural values, such as the importance of attaining community consensus, harmony, and interdependence. Rice farming has traditionally been hard work requiring a lot of resources—villages would pool their labor and tap into shared irrigation systems. Individual decisions impacted the collective, so group decision-making and avoidance of conflict became vital to survival and success. This print by Hiroshige showing a full moon reflected in multiple rice paddies is an example of how the paddies of multiple farmers are interconnected and share the same water source.

Japanese cultural and national identity are indistinguishable from rice, and the annual yield is considered a barometer of national health and wellbeing. As both the political and religious figurehead of the Japanese state the Emperor performed religious functions revolved around rice cultivation, ritually tending a royal rice paddy on the imperial palace grounds in Tokyo. Here, the late Emperor Hirohito plants rice in the imperial paddy.

The 38^th^ Emperor of Japan, Tenchi (r. 661—671) wrote a famous poem after taking shelter from the rain in a rice farmer's hut, and looking on in admiration of his hardworking subjects:

*Coarse the rush-mat roof\
Sheltering the harvest-hut\
Of the autumn rice-field;\
And my sleeves are growing wet\
With the moisture dripping through.*

(trans. Clay MacCauley, 1917)

The poem was included in an anthology entitled “100 Poems by 100 Poets” and assembled by the poet  Fujiwara no Teika around 1235. The poems were the subject of many Ukiyo-e woodblock prints, including this one by Kuniyoshi.
