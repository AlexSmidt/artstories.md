<p>Kuba kings’ official attire is rich with rare, luxury trappings like beads from Italy, Germany, and the Czech Republic, and shells that are hard to come by in the nearly land-locked Congo. In fact, cowrie shells were so valuable that they were once used as currency in the Kuba kingdom and elsewhere in Africa.</p>

<p>The king’s office weighs heavily on him, literally—the outfit of a fully decked-out king weighs in at about 185 pounds, perhaps as much as the man himself. In addition to this <i>yet </i>belt, the ceremonial regalia includes a skirt, hat, collar, gloves, necklaces, bracelets, armbands, anklets, shoes, and other ornaments. The materials, meanwhile, range from beads and shells to feathers and leopard pelts.</p>
