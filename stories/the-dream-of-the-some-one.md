This piece evolved from a vivid dream that Do Ho Suh once had in which he entered a large stadium where the ground was reflective and he heard what he first thought was the chirp of thousands of crickets. He recalls," then I saw this reflecting surface and I realized I was stepping on these metal pieces that were military dog tags. And they were vibrating slightly, vibrating and touching each other. The sound was from that. From afar I saw the central figure in the center of the stadium. It tried to go out of the stadium but it couldn't because the train of its garment, which was made of dog tags, was just too big. It was just too big to pull all the dog tags."

*Some/One* was created after a similar piece, *Metal Jacket*. The jacket is made from three thousand dog tags and sits atop a slim black stand.
