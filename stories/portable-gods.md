Large bronze images of gods, adorned and treated like royalty granting benediction to their people, process outside the temple in a ritual that goes back millennia. For *paraiyan* communities from the “untouchable” caste, still barred from temples in many places, it’s a chance to see the holy images in person.

In the inner sanctum of a temple, priests tend to the most holy icons, including bronzes. “Awakened” with chants, the sound of bells, incense, and candlelight, the deity is perceived as temporarily residing within the icon. At this moment, devotees may commune with the god, receiving *darshan*: the moment a god is seen and the god looks back, transferring grace.

South Indian temple bronzes are created using the lost wax technique, in which images are formed from beeswax then finely carved with a wooden chisel. The wax model is then encased in several layers of clay and heated, allowing the wax to melt and run out. Metal is then poured into the mold and, when cooled, the clay model is broken open to reveal a unique bronze.
