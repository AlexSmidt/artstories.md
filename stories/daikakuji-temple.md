Daikakuji was originally the villa of Emperor Saga (785–842). It was converted to a Shingon Buddhist temple in 876 and is still sometimes referred to as Saga Imperial Palace. The temple venerates the Five Wisdom Kings and is home to a set of wood sculptures from 1167 depicting the kings. The temple is also home to a copy of the Heart Sutra that was handwritten by Emperor Saga; as an official national treasure, it is only shown to the public every 60 years (the next display is slated for 2018). The artificial pond was created during the early 800s and is a popular place to visit during cherry blossom season, in the spring.

In the 1600s, the walls of several rooms in the Shōshinden building were painted by Kanō Sanraku and are now officially protected as national cultural property—visitors can peek into the rooms but not enter. The Peony Room is one of the most famous, with 18 sliding screens showing peonies amid rocks.
