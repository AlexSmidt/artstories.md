Poussin is known as one of the greatest French painters of all time, but he lived most of his life in Italy. As a young man in Paris, an artistic backwater at the time, he studied engravings of paintings by Raphael and other Italian Renaissance masters and set out for Italy as soon as he could.

In 1627, Poussin had the opportunity to work for Cardinal Barberini. The result of that commission was the painting we see here. The rest is history: just three years before, Poussin had arrived in Rome virtually an unknown artist. The success of his painting, “The Death of Germanicus,” cemented his reputation in the city.

The painting remained in the possession of Cardinal Barberini’s family until 1958, the year it was purchased by the MIA.

Poussin was also greatly inspired by the sensual color and heightened emotion of more recent Italian painters whose work he encountered in Rome and Venice, especially Titian and Caravaggio.

Poussin returned to France for only two years, summoned by King Louis XIII to decorate the Grand Gallery at the Louvre palace. Not one to delegate his art to assistants, he hated the work and returned to Rome as soon as he could. Yet even from afar, he earned a reputation as the greatest of French painters. Aspiring French artists traveled to Rome to study with him, and his teachings—based on classical theories of art—became the foundation of the curriculum at the French Royal Academy when it opened in 1648.
