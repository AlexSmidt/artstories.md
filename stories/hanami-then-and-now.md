Cherry blossom viewing parties, called *hanami*, have been a Japanese tradition for more than a thousand years. And artists have been depicting them for nearly as long. Here are two depictions, one far more casual than the other.

Cherry blossom gatherings are still a big deal in Japan, as shown here. This lunch box, which could be taken to *hanami, *is stuffed with many small delicacies, including one light pink fish cake in the shape of a cherry blossom.
