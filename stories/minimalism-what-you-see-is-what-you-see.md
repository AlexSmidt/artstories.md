The messy, loud Abstract Expressionists, bent on revealing their inner emotional life on the canvas, dominated the art world in the 1950s and 1960s. Every brush stroke and paint drip should remind the viewer of the artist and his or her work process, even after the paint had long dried. Their unbridled exuberance inspired an opposite trend in the 1960s and 1970s—the urge to eliminate any reference to the artist whatsoever. Art should refer only to itself. Minimalism, as it has become known, favored impersonal forms reduced to the most basic shapes and colors, rendered with an industrial coolness that betrays no sign of the hand that made it.

Frank Stella, a painter who originally worked in an Abstract Expressionist style, was among the first to work in a Minimalist style. Like other Minimalists, he believed a work of art should produce a purely visual response in the viewer, with no suggestion of meaning or emotion.

The hand of the artist was so unimportant to the Minimalists that it really didn’t matter who made a work of art so long as the artist’s idea was executed faithfully, like a composer of music or an architect. Much of Sol LeWitt’s work, for example, consists of nothing more than sets of instructions to be executed by someone else.

Donald Judd supplied fabrication shops with formulas to create wall pieces, such as Untitled.  The formula gave instructions on how to bend, shape, and polish the copper sculptures with machine-crafted precision to create beautiful mathematically proportioned objects and create a rhythm of geometric clarity.
