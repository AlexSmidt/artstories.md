The messy, loud Abstract Expressionists, bent on revealing their inner emotional life on the canvas, dominated the art world in the 1950s and ’60s. Every brush stroke and paint drip recalled the artist and the act of creation. Their exuberance inspired a backlash in the 1960s and ’70s—elimination of any reference to the artist whatsoever. Minimalism, as the movement came to be called, favored basic, impersonal shapes and colors, rendered with an industrial coolness that betrayed no sign of the hand that made it. Art, it suggested, should refer only to itself.

Frank Stella was an Abstract Expressionist painter before converting to Minimalism. He felt that the ideal response to a work of art was purely visual, without meaning or emotion.

The hand of the artist was so unimportant to the Minimalists that it really didn’t matter who made a work of art so long as the artist’s idea was executed faithfully, like a composer of music or an architect. Much of Sol LeWitt’s work, for example, consists of nothing more than sets of instructions to be executed by someone else.

Donald Judd supplied fabrication shops with formulas to create wall pieces such as Untitled, instructing them how to bend, shape, and polish the copper with machine-crafted precision to create beautiful mathematically proportioned objects and a rhythm of geometric clarity.
