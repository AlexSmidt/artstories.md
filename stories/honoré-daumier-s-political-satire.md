A consummate draftsman, Daumier produced countless illustrations and cartoons for contemporary journals, satirizing the seamy side of French society in the 1800s. Despite or perhaps because of this, he achieved little renown during his lifetime.

Daumier's political cartoons and illustrations, now widely admired, targeted the ineptitude and abuse of the French government and the foibles of the wealthy bourgeoisie and clergy. Many were published in the widely read comic weekly *La Caricature*.

Daumier was often censored for his anti-government illustrations and was arrested, fined, and imprisoned several times. In 1832 he was imprisoned for his pointed caricature of King Louis-Philippe as an oversized pear. Daumier sometimes produced lithographs simply to help pay his fines and legal bills.

Government censors eventually closed in on him, so he refocused his satirical lens on actors, artists, the legal profession, and other segments of French society. He produced more than 4,000 lithographs and 1,000 wood engravings during his career before going blind later in life. He was also a talented painter and sculptor, though most of these works only became known after his death.
