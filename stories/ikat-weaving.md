Sakalava people in Madagascar call ikat *laimasaka*, a word that means “cooked cloth.”  Ikat weaving involves laying out the warp (the threads that run lengthwise in a fabric), lightly binding the area to be left undyed, and then “cooking” the warp fibers in a series of dye applications. Kind of like tie-dye, except the fabric hasn’t been woven yet. When it is woven into a mat, the undyed areas create a design. This video shows a young woman from Kansas State University creating an ikat cloth.
