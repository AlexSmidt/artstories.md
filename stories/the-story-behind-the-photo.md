The Woodwards department store, built in 1903, was once a landmark in Vancouver and the anchor of the Gastown neighborhood. Shuttered during the 1980s recession, it was vacant until ownership transferred to the city. A redevelopment plan called for public housing, retail, and public spaces, and the developer commissioned Stan Douglas to create a public artwork to accompany the revitalized structure.

To recreate the riot, Stan Douglas staged the photograph like a movie scene.  He used actors, props, and cranes for cameras, and employed a crew of 100 assistants. He also had to improvise. When a store owner demanded \$100,000 to use the store window as a backdrop, Douglas decided he could build a replica street for less, creating a set in a Vancouver parking lot. Everything was reconstructed—from the street lamps to the vintage 1970s clothes and cars.

If you’re ever in Vancouver, you can visit the original 30-by-50-foot photomural at the corner of Abbott and Cordova streets. The image is translucent, so it can be viewed from either side. This explains why the mural in the photo appears backwards.
