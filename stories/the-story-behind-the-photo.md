The Woodwards department store, built in 1903, was once a landmark in Vancouver and the anchor of the Gastown neighborhood. Shuttered during the 1980s recession it lay vacant until ownership was transferred to the city of Vancouver. The city devised a redevelopment plan for the property that would include public housing, new retail spaces, and public areas. The developer commissioned Stan Douglas to create a public artwork to accompany the revitalized structure.

To recreate the riot, Stan Douglas staged the photograph like a movie scene.  He used actors, props, and cranes for cameras, and employed a crew of 100 assistants.  And, like many a movie director, he had to improvise. When a store owner on the “real” street requested \$100,000 to use the store window as a backdrop, Douglas decided he could build a replica street for less, creating a set in a Vancouver parking lot. So, everything that you see in the photo is reconstructed—from the street lamps to the vintage 1970s clothes and cars

If you’re ever in Vancouver, you can visit the original 30’ by 50’ photomural, printed on tempered glass, above the atrium in the Woodward’s complex at the corner of Abbott and Cordova Streets.  The image is translucent, and can be viewed from either side. This explains why the mural in the photo appears backwards.
