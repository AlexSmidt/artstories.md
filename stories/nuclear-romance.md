Photography has a strange romance with the atomic bomb.  Common images of atomic explosions rarely show the death, agony and pain that nuclear bombs have wrought on civilian populations at the time of impact and for generations thereafter.  Instead, we are presented with images of test bombs, taken from the safe distant of an aerial perspective, that explode in oceans or on unoccupied deserts.

Pictures of atomic bombs are typically majestic, beautifully colorful orange clouds that extend into the sky like exhale of a god.  But Tamatsu’s photograph gives human dimension to Nagasaki’s monumental and sudden destruction with a single object worn by a single individual.  He creates a modest and delicate image that transcends a time-bound event.  He gives us an image of time, stopped.  The end of a single human life, one among the many who perished.
