Baer would have used a hammer and a raising anvil to shape the basic form of the cup. The metal needed to be hot enough to shape without breaking, but not so hot that it would melt on impact.

The large sculptures were first formed in wax, encased in a sturdy mold, and heated. When the wax melted out, molten silver was poured into its place. After cooling, the mold was cracked off to reveal the silver object, which might later be soldered to other parts to form an entire sculpture.

Some parts of the design would be hammered into the piece from the inside of the vessel, a technique called embossing. The embossed shapes can be seen both from the inside (as a negative form) and the outside.

Other parts of the design would be engraved or punched directly into the surface from the outside, a technique called chasing. The sky in this relief is chased – here: polished - for ultimate smoothness, almost like a mirror.

Baer showed off by using multiple techniques in spectacular fashion—some of the horses are cast figures, others are embossed from behind, and a whole village is chased with engraved lines in the background. He even included details like tiny puffs of smoke wafting from the pistol barrels.
